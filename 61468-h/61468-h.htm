<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was the intention of the Biographer of <span class="smcap">Doctor Burney</span>, to have
printed the Doctor’s Correspondence, in a fourth volume, at the same
time with the Memoir; but upon examining the collection, there appears
such a dearth of the Doctor’s own Letters, of which he very rarely kept
copies, that it seems to be expedient to postpone their publication, till it
can be rendered more complete; to which end, the Biographer ventures
earnestly to entreat, that all who possess any original Letters of Doctor
Burney, whether addressed to themselves, or retained by inheritance,
will have the goodness&mdash;where there seems no objection to their meeting
the public eye&mdash;to forward them to Mr. <span class="smcap">Moxon</span>, who will carefully
transmit them to the Biographer, by whom they will afterwards be
restored to their owners, with the most grateful acknowledgments.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> intentions, or, rather, the directions of Dr.
Burney that his Memoirs should be published; and
the expectation of his family and friends that they
should pass through the hands of his present
Editor and Memorialist, have made the task of
arranging the ensuing collations with her own
personal recollections, appear to her a sacred duty
from the year 1814.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>But the grief at his loss, which at first incapacitated
her from such an effort, was soon afterwards
followed by change of place, change of circumstances&mdash;almost
of existence&mdash;with multiplied casualties
that, eventually, separated her from all her
manuscript materials. And these she only recovered

<span class="pagenum">[vi]</span>

when under the pressure of a new affliction
that took from her all power, or even thought, for
their investigation. During many years, therefore,
they have been laid aside, though never forgotten.</p>

<p>But if Time, as so often we lament, will not
stand still upon happiness, it would be graceless
not to acknowledge, with gratitude to Providence,
that neither is it positively stationary upon sorrow:
for though there are calamities which it cannot
obliterate, and wounds which Religion alone can
heal, Time yet seems endowed with a secret principle
for producing a mental calm, through which
life imperceptibly glides back to its customary
operations; however powerless Time itself&mdash;earthly
Time!&mdash;must still remain for restoring lost felicity.</p>

<p>Now, therefore,&mdash;most unexpectedly,&mdash;that she
finds herself sufficiently recovered from successive
indispositions and afflictions to attempt the acquittal
of a debt which has long hung heavily upon
her mind, she ventures to re-open her manuscript
stores, and to resume, though in trembling, her
long-forsaken pen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[vii]</span></p>

<p>That the life of so eminent a man should not
pass away without some authenticated record, will
be pretty generally thought; and the circumstances
which render her its recorder, grow out of the very
nature of things: she possesses all his papers and
documents; and, from her earliest youth to his
latest decline, not a human being was more confidentially
entrusted than herself with the occurrences,
the sentiments, and the feelings of his past
and passing days.</p>

<p>Although, as biography, from time immemorial,
has claimed the privilege of being more discursive
than history, the Memorialist may seek to diversify
the plain recital of facts by such occasional anecdotes
as have been hoarded from childhood in her
memory; still, and most scrupulously, not an opinion
will be given as Dr. Burney’s, either of persons
or things, that was not literally his own: and fact
will as essentially be the basis of every article, as
if its object were still lent to earth, and now listening
to this exposition of his posthumous memoirs
with her own recollections.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[viii]</span></p>

<p>Nevertheless, though nothing is related that does
not belong to Dr. Burney and his history, the
accounts are not always rigidly confined to his
presence, where scenes, or traits, still strong in
the remembrance of the Editor, or still before her
eyes in early letters or diaries, invite to any characteristic
details of celebrated personages.</p>

<p>Not slight, however, is the embarrassment that
struggles with the pleasure of these mingled reminiscences,
from their appearance of personal obtrusion:
yet, when it is seen that they are never
brought forward but to introduce some incident
or speech, that must else remain untold of Dr.
Johnson, Mr. Burke, Mrs. Delany, Mrs. Thrale,
Mr. Bruce&mdash;nay, Napoleon&mdash;and some other high-standing
names, of recent date to the aged, yet of
still living curiosity to the youthful reader&mdash;these
apparent egotisms may be something more,&mdash;perhaps&mdash;than
pardoned.</p>

<p>Where the life has been as private as that of
Dr. Burney, its history must necessarily be simple,
and can have little further call upon the attention
of the world, than that which may belong to a wish

<span class="pagenum">[ix]</span>

of tracing the progress of a nearly abandoned
Child, from a small village of Shropshire, to a
Man allowed throughout Europe to have risen to
the head of his profession; and thence, setting his
profession aside, to have been elevated to an intellectual
rank in society, as a Man of Letters&mdash;</p>

<div class="topspace1"></div>

<p class="center smaller">“Though not First, in the very first line”</p>

<div class="topspace1"></div>

<p>with most of the eminent men of his day,&mdash;Dr.
Johnson and Mr. Burke, soaring above any contemporary
mark, always, like Senior Wranglers, excepted.</p>

<p>And to this height, to which, by means and
resources all his own, he arose, the Genius that
impelled him to Fame, the Integrity that established
his character, and the Amiability that magnetized all
hearts,&mdash;in the phrase of Dr. Johnson&mdash;<cite>to go forth
to meet him</cite>, were the only materials with which
he worked his way.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">COPIED FROM A MANUSCRIPT MEMOIR IN THE DOCTOR’S<br />
OWN HAND-WRITING.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> the life of a humble individual, on whom
neither splendid appointments, important transactions,
nor atrocious crimes have called the attention
of the public, can afford amusement to the friends
he leaves behind, without being offered either as a
model to follow, or a precipice to shun, the intention
of the writer of these Memoirs will be fully
accomplished. But there is no member of society
who, by diligence, talents, or conduct, leaves his
name and his race a little better than those from
which he sprung, who is totally without some claim
to attention on the means by which such advantages
were achieved.</p>

<p>My life, though it has been frequently a tissue of
toil, sickness, and sorrow, has yet been, upon the

<span class="pagenum">[xi]</span>

whole, so much more pleasant and prosperous than
I had a title to expect, or than many others with
higher claims have enjoyed, that its incidents, when
related, may, perhaps, help to put mediocrity in
good-humour, and to repress the pride and overrated
worth and expectations of indolence.</p>

<p>Perhaps few have been better enabled to describe,
from an actual survey, the manners and customs of
the age in which he lived than myself; ascending
from those of the most humble cottagers, and lowest
mechanics, to the first nobility, and most elevated
personages, with whom circumstances, situation, and
accident, at different periods of my life, have rendered
me familiar. Oppressed and laborious husbandmen;
insolent and illiberal yeomanry; overgrown
farmers; generous and hospitable merchants;
men of business and men of pleasure; men of
letters; men of science; artists; sportsmen and
country ’squires; dissipated and extravagant voluptuaries;
gamesters; ambassadors; statesmen; and
even sovereign princes, I have had opportunities
of examining in almost every point of view: all
these it is my intention to display in their respective
situations; and to delineate their virtues,
vices, and apparent degrees of happiness and
misery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[xii]</span></p>

<p>A book of this kind, though it may mortify and
offend a few persons of the present age, may be read
with avidity at the distance of some centuries, by
antiquaries and lovers of anecdotes; though it will
have lost the poignancy of personality.</p>

<p>My grandfather, James Macburney, who, by
letters which I have seen of his writing, and circumstances
concerning him which I remember to
have heard from my father and mother, was a gentleman
of a considerable patrimony at Great Hanwood,
a village in Shropshire, had received a
very good education; but, from what cause does
not appear, in the latter years of his life, was
appointed land steward to the Earl of Ashburnham.
He had a house in Privy Garden, Whitehall. In
the year 1727, he walked as esquire to one of the
knights, at the coronation of King George the
Second.</p>

<p>My father, James, born likewise at Hanwood,
was well educated also, both in school learning
and accomplishments. He was a day scholar at
Westminster School, under the celebrated Dr.
Busby, while my grandfather resided at Whitehall.

<span class="pagenum">[xiii]</span>

I remember his telling a story of the severe chastisement
he received from that terrific disciplinarian,
Dr. Busby, for playing truant after school hours,
instead of returning home. My grandfather, who
had frequently admonished him not to loiter in the
street, lest he should make improper and mischievous
acquaintance, finding no attention was
paid to his injunctions, gave him a letter addressed
to the Reverend Dr. Busby; which he did not
fail to deliver, with ignorant cheerfulness, on his
entrance into the school. The Doctor, when he
had perused it, called my father to him, and, in a
very mild, and seemingly good-humoured voice,
said, “Burney, can you read writing?” “Yes, Sir,”
answered my father, with great courage and
flippancy. “Then read this letter aloud,” says
the Doctor; when my father, with an audible voice,
began: “Sir, My son, the bearer of this letter,
having long disregarded my admonitions against
stopping to play with idle boys in his way home
from school&mdash;” Here my father’s voice faltered.
“Go on,” says his master; “you read very well.”
“I am sorry to be under the necessity of entreating
you to&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;to cor&mdash;” Here he threw down
the letter, and fell on his knees, crying out:
“Indeed, Sir, I’ll never do so again!&mdash;Pray forgive
me!” “O, you read perfectly well,” the

<span class="pagenum">[xiv]</span>

Doctor again tells him, “pray finish the Letter:”
And making him pronounce aloud the words,
“correct him;” complied with my grandfather’s
request in a very liberal manner.</p>

<p>Whether my father was intended for any particular
profession, I know not, but, during his youth, besides
his school learning, he acquired several talents
and accomplishments, which, in the course of his
life, he was obliged professionally to turn to account.
He danced remarkably well; performed well on
the violin, and was a portrait painter of no mean
talents.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the Mac which was prefixed to
my grandfather’s name, and which my father retained
for some time, I never could find at what
period any of my ancestors lived in Scotland or in
Ireland, from one of which it must have been
derived. My father and grandfather were both
born in Shropshire, and never even visited either of
those countries.</p>

<p>Early in his life, my father lost the favour of his
sire, by eloping from home, to marry a young
actress of Goodman’s-fields’ theatre, by whom he
had a very large family. My grandfather’s affection
was completely alienated by this marriage;

<span class="pagenum">[xv]</span>

joined to disapproving his son’s conduct in other
respects. To the usual obduracy of old age, he
afterwards added a far more than similar indiscretion
himself, by marrying a female domestic, to
whom, and to a son, the consequence of that marriage,
he bequeathed all his possessions, which were
very considerable. Joseph, this son, was not more
prudent than my father; for he contrived, early in
life, to dissipate his patrimony; and he subsisted
for many years in Norfolk, by teaching to dance.
I visited him in 1756, in a tour I made to Yarmouth.
He lived then at Ormsby, a beautiful
village near that town, with an amiable wife, and a
large family of beautiful children, in an elegant
villa, with a considerable garden; and he appeared,
at that time, in perfectly restored and easy circumstances.</p>

<p>N. B.&mdash;The fragment whence this is taken here
stops.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This Introduction, which is copied literally from
the hand-writing of Dr. Burney, was both begun and
dropped, as appears by a marginal note, in the year

<span class="pagenum">[xvi]</span>

1782; but, from what cause is unknown, was neither
continued, nor resumed, save by occasional memorandums,
till the year 1807, when the Doctor had
reached the age of eighty-one, and was under the
dejecting apprehension of a paralytic seizure. From
that time, nevertheless, he composed sundry manuscript
volumes, of various sizes, containing the
history of his life, from his cradle nearly to his
grave.</p>

<p>Out of the minute amplitude of this vast mass of
matter, it has seemed the duty of his Editor and
Memorialist, to collect all that seemed to offer any
interest for the general reader; but to commit
nothing to the public eye that there is reason to
believe the author himself would have withheld from
it at an earlier period; or would have obliterated,
even at a much later, had he revised his writings
after the recovery of his health and spirits.</p>

MEMOIRS<br />
<span class="xsmall">OF</span><br />
DOCTOR BURNEY.
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles Burney</span> was born at Shrewsbury, on
the twelfth of April, 1726.</p>

<p>He was issue of a second marriage, of a very
different colour with respect to discretion, or to prejudice,
from that with the account of which he has
opened his own narration. The poor actress was
no more; but neither her hardly judged, though
enthusiastically admired profession, nor her numerous
offspring, nor the alienation she had unhappily
caused in the family, proved obstacles to the subsequent
union of her survivor with Miss * * *
who in those days, though young and pretty, was
called Mrs. Ann Cooper, a Shropshire young lady,
of bright parts and great personal beauty; as well

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 2]</span>

as an inheritress of a fortune which, for the times,
was by no means inconsiderable. The parchments
of the marriage settlement upon this occasion are
still remaining amongst the few family records that
Dr. Burney preserved.</p>

<p>Whether attracted by her beauty, her sprightliness,
or her portion; or by the aggregate influence
of those three mighty magnetizers of the passions
of man, is not known; but Wycherley, the famous
poet, fine gentleman, and Wit of the reign of Charles
the Second, had been so enamoured with Mrs. Ann
Cooper in her earliest youth, which flourished in his
latest decadency, that he sought her for his bride.</p>

<p>The romance, however, of his adoration, did
not extend to breaking his heart; for though he
expired within a few months after her rejection, it
was not from wearing the willow: another fair one,
yet younger, proved less cruel, and changed it to a
wreath of myrtle. But the fates were adverse to
his tender propensities, and he outlived his fair
fortune and his nuptials only a fortnight.</p>

<p>A few years after this second marriage, Mr.
Burney senior, finally, and with tolerable success,
fixed himself to the profession of portrait-painting;
and, quitting Shrewsbury, established himself in the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 3]</span>

city of Chester; where, to his reputation in the
delightful arts of the pencil, he joined a far surpassing
pre-eminence in those of society. His convivial
spirit, his ready repartee, and his care-chasing
pleasantry, made his intercourse sought by all to
whom such qualifications afford pleasure: and we
are yet, I believe, to learn where coin of such
sterling value for exhilarating our fellow-creatures,
fails of passing current.</p>

<p>The then Earl of Cholmondeley was particularly

<p>Charles, who was Mr. Burney’s last born son,
had a twin sister, called Susanna, whom he early
lost, but for whom he cherished a peculiar fondness

beloved and meritorious daughter to whom he gave
her name.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CONDOVER.</h3>

<p>From what cause is not known, and it is difficult
to conceive any that can justify such extraordinary
neglect, young Charles was left in Shropshire, upon
the removal of his parents to Chester; and abandoned,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 4]</span>

not only during his infancy, but even during
his boyhood, to the care of an uncultivated and
utterly ignorant, but worthy and affectionate old
nurse, called Dame Ball, in the rustic village of
Condover, not far from Shrewsbury.</p>

<p>His reminiscences upon this period were amongst
those the most tenaciously minute, and the most
agreeable to his fancy for detail, of any part of his
life; and the uncommon gaiety of his narratory
powers, and the frankness with which he set forth
the pecuniary embarrassments and provoking mischances,
to which his thus deserted childhood was
exposed, had an ingenuousness, a good-humour, and
a comicality, that made the subject of Condover
not more delectable to himself than entertaining
to his hearer.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, these accounts, when committed to
paper, and produced without the versatility of countenance,
and the vivacious gestures that animated
the colloquial disclosures, so lose their charm, as
to appear vapid, languid, and tedious: and the
editor only thus slightly recurs to them for the
purpose of pointing out how gifted must be the
man who, through disadvantages of so lowering
a species, could become, in after-life, not only one

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 5]</span>

of the best informed, but one of the most polished,
members of society.</p>

<p>There were few subjects of his childish remembrance
with which he was himself more amused,
than with the recital of the favourite couplets which
the good nurse Ball most frequently sang to him
at her spinning wheel; and which he especially
loved to chaunt, in imitating her longdrawn face,
and the dolorous tones of her drawling sadness.</p>

<p>The education of the subject of these memoirs,
when, at length, he was removed from this his
first instructress, whom he quitted, as he always
protested, with agony of grief, was begun at the
Free School at Chester.</p>

<p>It can excite no surprise, his brilliant career

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 6]</span>

through life considered, that his juvenile studies
were assiduous, ardent, and successful. He was frequently
heard to declare that he had been once
only chastised at school, and that not for slackness,
but forwardness in scholastic lore. A favourite
comrade, who shared his affections, though
not his application or his genius, was hesitating
through an ill-learnt lesson, and on the point of
incurring punishment, when young Burney, dropping
his head on his breast to muffle his voice,
whispered the required answer.</p>

<p>“Burney prompts, Sir!” was loudly called out
by a jealous, or malevolent fellow-student: and
Burney paid the ignoble tax at which his incautious
good nature, and superior talents, were assessed.</p>

<p>The resources of practical education ought, perhaps,
to be judged only by the experience which
puts them into play; but incongruous, at least to
all thinking, though it may be incompetent, observers,
must seem the discipline that appoints to the
instinctive zeal of youthful friendship, the same
degrading species of punishment that may be necessary
for counteracting the sluggard mischiefs
of indolence, or the dangerous examples of misconduct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>The prominent talents of young Burney for music
fixed that tuneful art for his profession; and happily
so; for while its pursuit was his business, its
cultivation was his never-ceasing delight.</p>

<p>Yet not exclusively: far otherwise. He had a
native love of literature, in all its branches, that
opened his intellects to observation, while it furnished
his mind with embellishments upon almost
every subject; a thirst of knowledge, that rendered
science, as far as he had opportunity for its investigation,
an enlargement to his understanding; and
an imagination that invested all the arts with a
power of enchantment.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">SHREWSBURY.</h3>

<p>His earliest musical instructor was his eldest half
brother, Mr. James Burney, who was then, and for
more than half a century afterwards, organist of St.
Margaret’s, Shrewsbury; in which city the young
musician elect began his professional studies.</p>

<p>It was, however, in age only that Mr. James
Burney was his brother’s senior or superior; from
him, therefore, whatever could be given or received,
was finished almost ere it was begun, from the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 8]</span>

quickness with which his pupil devoted himself to
what he called the slavery of conquering unmeaning
difficulties in the lessons of the times.</p>

<p>The following spirited paragraph on his juvenile
progress is transcribed from his early memorandums.</p>

<div class="topspace2"></div>

<blockquote>
<p>“The celebrated Felton, and after him, the first Dr. Hayes,
came from Oxford to Shrewsbury on a tour, while I was studying
hard, without instruction or example; and they amazed and
stimulated me so forcibly by their performance on the organ,
as well as by their encouragement, that I thenceforward went to
work with an ambition and fury that would hardly allow me to
eat or sleep.</p>

<p>“The quantity of music which I copied at this time, of all
kinds, was prodigious; and my activity and industry surprised
every body; for, besides writing, teaching, tuning, and playing
for my brother, at my <i lang="fr">momens perdus</i>, I was educating myself
in every way I was able. With copy-books, I improved my
hand-writing so much, that my father did not believe I wrote
my letters to him myself. I tried hard to at least keep up the
little Latin I had learned; and I diligently practised both the
spinet and violin; which, with reading, transcribing music for
business, and poetry for pleasure; attempts at composition, and
attention to my brother’s affairs, filled up every minute of the
longest day.</p>

<p>“I had, also, a great passion for angling; but whenever I
could get leisure to pursue that sport, I ran no risk of losing my
time, if the fish did not bite; for I had always a book in my
pocket, which enabled me to wait with patience their pleasure.”</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="topspace2"></div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>Another paragraph, which is singular and amusing,
is transcribed, also, from the Shrewsbury Annals:&mdash;</p>

<div class="topspace2"></div>

<blockquote>
<p class="center smaller">“CHARACTER OF LADY TANKERVILLE.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>“This lady was the daughter of Sir John Ashley, of the
Abbey Foregate, Shrewsbury. She manifested a passion for
music very early, in practising on the German flute, which was
then little known in the country, Sir William Fowler and this
lady being the only performers on that instrument that obtained,
or deserved the least notice. Miss Ashley practised the harpsichord
likewise, and took lessons of my brother: and she used
to make little Matteis, the language master, and first violinist of
the place, accompany her. She was an <i lang="fr">espiegle</i>, and doted on
mischief; and no sooner found that Matteis was very timid and
helpless at the slightest distress or danger, than she insisted,
during summer, upon taking her lessons in the middle of an old
and lofty oak tree; placing there a seat and a desk, adroitly well
arranged for her accommodation; while another seat and desk,
upon a thick but tottering branch, was put up for poor Matteis,
who was so terrified, that he could not stop a note in tune; yet
so fearful, that he could not bring himself to resist her orders.</p>

<p>“In 1738, she married Lord Ossulston, son of the Earl of
Tankerville: and I remember leading off a choral song, or
hymn, by her direction, to chaunt her out of St. Julian’s Church.
I was then quite a boy; and I heard no more of her till I was
grown up, and settled in London.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 10]</span></p>
<h3 class="nobreak">CHESTER.</h3>

<p>On quitting Shrewsbury to return to his parents
at Chester, the ardour of young Burney for improvement
was such as to absorb his whole being;
and his fear lest a moment of daylight should be
profitless, led him to bespeak a labouring boy, who
rose with the sun, to awaken him regularly with
its dawn. Yet, as he durst not pursue his education
at the expense of the repose of his family, he
hit upon the ingenious device of tying one end of
a ball of pack-thread round his great toe, and then
letting the ball drop, with the other end just within
the boy’s reach, from an aperture in the old-fashioned
casement of his bed-chamber window.</p>

<p>This was no contrivance to dally with his diligence;
he could not choose but rise.</p>

<p>He was yet a mere youth, when, while thus
unremittingly studious, he was introduced to Dr.
Arne, on the passage of that celebrated musician
through the city of Chester, when returning from
Ireland: and this most popular of English vocal
composers since the days of Purcel, was so much
pleased with the talents of this nearly self-instructed
performer, as to make an offer to Mr. Burney

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 11]</span>

senior, upon such conditions as are usual to such
sort of patronage, to complete the musical education
of this lively and aspiring young man; and to
bring him forth to the world as his favourite and
most promising pupil.</p>

<p>To this proposal Mr. Burney senior was induced
to consent; and, in the year 1714, at the age of
seventeen, the eager young candidate for fame rapturously
set off, in company with Dr. Arne, for
the metropolis.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">LONDON.</h3>

<p>Arrived in London, young Burney found himself
unrestrainedly his own master, save in what
regarded his articled agreement with Dr. Arne.
Every part of his numerous family was left behind
him, or variously dispersed, with the single exception
of his elder and only own brother, Richard
Burney, afterwards of Worcester, but who, at this
period, was settled in the capital.</p>

<p>This brother was a man of true worth and
vigorous understanding, enriched with a strong
vein of native humour. He was an indefatigable
and sapient collector of historical portraits, and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 12]</span>

passionately fond of the arts; and he was father
of a race of children who severally, and with distinction,
shone in them all; and who superadded
to their ingenuity and their acquirements the most
guileless hearts and scrupulous integrity.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">DR. ARNE.</h3>

<p>Dr. Arne, professionally, has been fully portrayed
by the pupil who, nominally, was under his
guidance; but who, in after-times, became the
historian of his tuneful art.</p>

<p>Eminent, however, in that art as was Dr. Arne,
his eminence was to that art alone confined.
Thoughtless, dissipated, and careless, he neglected,
or rather scoffed at all other but musical reputation.
And he was so little scrupulous in his ideas of
propriety, that he took pride, rather than shame,
in being publicly classed, even in the decline of life,
as a man of pleasure.</p>

<p>Such a character was ill qualified to form or to
protect the morals of a youthful pupil; and it is
probable that not a notion of such a duty ever
occurred to Dr. Arne; so happy was his self-complacency
in the fertility of his invention and the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 13]</span>

ease of his compositions, and so dazzled by the
brilliancy of his success in his powers of melody&mdash;which,
in truth, for the English stage, were in
sweetness and variety unrivalled&mdash;that, satisfied and
flattered by the practical exertions and the popularity
of his fancy, he had no ambition, or, rather,
no thought concerning the theory of his art.</p>

<p>The depths of science, indeed, were the last that
the gay master had any inclination to sound; and,
in a very short time, through something that mingled
jealousy with inability, the disciple was wholly left
to work his own way as he could through the
difficulties of his professional progress.</p>

<p>Had neglect, nevertheless, been the sole deficiency
that young Burney had had to lament, it
would effectually have been counteracted by his
own industry: but all who are most wanting to
others, are most rapacious of services for themselves;
and the time in which the advancement of
the scholar ought to have been blended with the
advantage of the teacher, was almost exclusively
seized upon for the imposition of laborious tasks of
copying music: and thus, a drudgery fitted for those
who have no talents to cultivate; or those who, in
possessing them, are driven from their enjoyment by

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 14]</span>

distress, filled up nearly the whole time of the student,
and constituted almost wholly the directions of
the tutor.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">MRS. CIBBER.</h3>

<p>Young Burney, now, was necessarily introduced
to Dr. Arne’s celebrated sister, the most enchanting
actress of her day, Mrs. Cibber; in whose house,
in Scotland-yard, he found himself in a constellation
of wits, poets, actors, authors, and men of
letters.</p>

<p>The social powers of pleasing, which to the very
end of his long life endeared him to every circle in
which he mixed, were now first lighted up by the
sparks of convivial collision which emanate, in kindred
minds, from the electricity of conversation.
And though, as yet, he was but a gazer himself
in the splendour of this galaxy, he had parts of such
quick perception, and so laughter-loving a taste
for wit and humour, that he not alone received
delight from the sprightly sallies, the ludicrous
representations, or the sportive mimicries that here,
with all the frolic of high-wrought spirits, were
bandied about from guest to guest; he contributed

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 15]</span>

personally to the general enjoyment, by the gaiety
of his participation; and appeared, to all but his
modest self, to make an integral part of the brilliant
society into which he was content, nay charmed,
to seem admitted merely as an auditor.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">GARRICK.</h3>

<p>Conspicuous in this bright assemblage, Garrick,
then hardly beyond the glowing dawn of his unparalleled
dramatic celebrity, shone forth with a blaze
of lustre that struck young Burney with enthusiastic
admiration.</p>

<p>And nearly as prompt was the kind impression
made in return, by the new young associate, on
the fancy and the liking of this inimitable outward
delineator of the inward human character; who, to
the very close of that splendid circle which he
described in the drama and in literature, retained
for this early conquest a distinguishing, though
not, perhaps, a wholly unremitting partiality; for
where is the spoilt child, whether of the nursery
or of the public, who is uniformly exempt from
fickleness or caprice,&mdash;those wayward offsprings of
lavish indulgence?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>Not dense, however, nor frequent, were the occasional
intermissions to the serenity of their intercourse;
and the sunshine by which they were
dispersed, beamed from an heightened esteem that,
in both parties, terminated in cordial affection.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">THOMSON.</h3>

<p>With Thomson, too, whose fame, happily for
posterity, hung not upon the ephemeral charm of
accent, variety of attitude, or witchery of the eye,
like that of even the most transcendent of the
votaries of the buskins; with Thomson, too, his
favoured lot led him to the happiness of early and
intimate, though, unfortunately, not of long-enduring
acquaintance, the destined race of Thomson,
which was cut short nearly in the meridian of
life, being already almost run.</p>

<p>It was not in the house only of Mrs. Cibber
that he met this impressive and piety-inspiring
painter of Nature, alike in her rural beauties and
her elemental sublimities: the young musician had
the advantage of setting to music a part of the
mask of Alfred,<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
which brought him into close contact with the author,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 17]</span>

and rivetted good will on one side by high admiration
on the other.</p>

<p>With various persons, renowned or interesting,
of the same set, who were gaily basking, at this
period, in the smiles of popular sunshine, the subject
of these memoirs daily mixed; but, unfortunately,
not a memorandum of their intercourse has he
left, beyond their names.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cibber herself he considered as a pattern
of perfection in the tragic art, from her magnetizing
powers of harrowing and winning at once
every feeling of the mind, by the eloquent sensibility
with which she portrayed, or, rather, personified,
Tenderness, Grief, Horror, or Distraction.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">KIT SMART.</h3>

<p>With a different set, and at a different part of
the town, young Burney formed an intimacy with
Kit Smart, the poet; a man then in equal possession
of those finest ingredients for the higher call of
his art, fire and fancy, and, for its comic call, of sport
and waggery. No indication, however, of such possession
was granted to his appearance; not a grace
was bestowed on his person or manners; and his

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 18]</span>

physiognomy was of that round and stubbed form
that seemed appertaining to a common dealer behind
a common counter, rather than to a votary of the
Muses. But his intellects, unhappily, were more
brilliant than sound; and his poetic turn, though
it never warped his sentiments or his heart, was
little calculated to fortify his judgment.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">DOCTOR ARMSTRONG.</h3>

<p>And, at this same epoch, the subject of these
memoirs began also an intercourse with the celebrated
Dr. Armstrong, as high, then, in the theory
of his art, medicine, as he was far from lucratively
prosperous in its practice. He had produced upon
it a didactic poem, “The Art of Preserving Health,”
which young Burney considered to be as nervous in
diction as it was enlightening in precept. But Dr.
Armstrong, though he came from a part of the
island whence travellers are by no means proverbially
smitten with the reproach of coming in
vain; nor often stigmatized with either meriting
or being addicted to failure, possessed not the personal
skill usually accorded to his countrymen, of
adroitness in bringing himself forward. Yet he

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 19]</span>

was as gaily amiable as he was eminently learned;
and though, from a keen moral sense of right, he
was a satirist, he was so free from malevolence, that
the smile with which he uttered a remark the most
ironical, had a cast of good-humoured pleasantry
that nearly turned his sarcasm into simple sport.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">MISS MOLLY CARTER.</h3>

<p>Now, also, opened to him an acquaintance with
Miss Molly Carter, a lady who, ultimately, proved
the oldest friend that he sustained through life; a
sacred title, of which the rights, on both sides, were
affectionately acknowledged. The following account
of her is copied from Dr. Burney’s early manuscripts.</p>

<div class="topspace2"></div>

<blockquote>
<p>“Miss Molly Carter, in her youth a very pretty girl, was,
in the year 1745, of a large party of young ladies, consisting
of five or six Miss Gores, and Miss Anderson, at William
Thompson’s Esq., in the neighbourhood of Elsham, near Brig.
Bob Thompson, Mr. Thompson’s brother, Billy Le Grand,
and myself, composed the rest of the set, which was employed
in nothing but singing, dancing, romping, and visiting, the
whole time I was there; which time was never surpassed in
hilarity at any place where I have been received in my life.”</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="topspace2"></div>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">QUEEN MAB.</h3>

<p>Neither pleasure, however, nor literary pursuits,
led young Burney to neglect the cultivation of his
musical talents. The mask of Alfred was by no
means his sole juvenile composition: he set to music
the principal airs in the English burletta called
Robin Hood, which was most flatteringly received
at the theatre; and he composed the whole of the
music of the pantomime of Queen Mab.</p>

<p>He observed at this time the strictest incognito
concerning all these productions, though no motive
for it is found amongst his papers; nor does there
remain any recollective explanation.</p>

<p>With regard to Queen Mab, it excited peculiar
remark, from the extraordinary success of that diverting
pantomime; for when the uncertainties of
the representation were over, there was every stimulus
to avowal that could urge a young author to
come forward; not with adventurous boldness, nor
yet with trembling timidity, but with the frank
delight of unequivocal success.</p>

<p>Queen Mab had a run which, to that time,
had never been equalled, save by the opening of

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 21]</span>

the Beggar’s Opera; and which has not since
been surpassed, save by the representation of the
Duenna.</p>

<p>Its music, pleasing and natural, was soon so popular,
that it was taught to all young ladies, set to
all barrel organs, and played at all familiar music
parties. It aimed not at Italian refinement, nor
at German science; but its sprightly melody, and
utter freedom from vulgarity, made its way even
with John Bull, who, while following the hairbreadth
agility of Harlequin, the skittish coquetries
of Columbine, and the merry dole of the disasters
of the Clown and Pantaloon, found himself insensibly
caught, and unconsciously beguiled into ameliorated
musical taste.</p>

<p>In the present day, when English singers sometimes
rise to the Italian opera, and when Italian
singers are sometimes invited to the English, the
music of Queen Mab could be received but in common
with the feats of its pantomime; so rapidly
has taste advanced, and so generally have foreign
improvements become nearly indigenous.</p>

<p>To give its due to merit, and its rights to invention,
we must always go back to their origin, and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 22]</span>

judge them, not by any comparison with what has
followed them, but by what they met when they first
started, and by what they were preceded.</p>

<p>Why, when success was thus ascertained, the name
of the composer was concealed, leaving him thus
singularly as unknown as he was popular, may the
more be regretted, as his disposition, though chiefly
domestic, was not of that effeminately sensitive
cast that shrinks from the world’s notice with a
dread of publicity. His mind, on the contrary,
belonged to his sex; and was eminently formed to
expand with that manly ambition, which opens the
portals of hope to the attainment of independence,
through intellectual honours.</p>

<p>The music, when printed, made its appearance in
the world as the offspring of <cite>a society of the sons
of Apollo</cite>: and Oswald, a famous bookseller, published
it by that title, and knew nothing of its real
parentage.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Sundry airs, ballads, cantatas, and other light
musical productions, were put forth also, as from

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 23]</span>

that imaginary society; but all sprang from the
same source, and all were equally unacknowledged.</p>

<p>The sole conjecture to be formed upon a self-denial,
to which no virtue seems attached; and from
which reason withdraws its sanction, as tending to
counteract the just balance between merit and recompense,
is, that possibly the articles then in force
with Dr. Arne, might disfranchise young Burney
from the liberty of publication in his own name.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">EARL OF HOLDERNESSE.</h3>

<p>The first musical work by the subject of these
memoirs that he openly avowed, was a set of six
sonatas for two violins and a bass, printed in 1747,
and dedicated to the Earl of Holdernesse; to whose
notice the author had been presented by some of
the titled friends and protectors to whom he had
become accidentally known.</p>

<p>The Earl not only accepted with pleasure the
music and the dedication, but conceived a regard
for the young composer, that soon passed from his
talents to his person and character. Many notes
of Lord Holdernesse still remain of kind engagements
for meetings, even after his time was under

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 24]</span>

the royal, though honourable restraint, of being
governor of the heir apparent.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
That high, and nearly exclusive occupation, lessened not the favour
which his lordship had had the taste and discernment to display so
early for a young man whom, afterwards, with pleasure, if not with
pride, he must have seen rise to equal and general favour in the
world.</p>

<p>At Holdernesse House,<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
the fine mansion of this earl, young Burney began an acquaintance,
which in after years ripened into intimacy, with Mr.
Mason, the poet, who was his lordship’s chaplain.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">FULK GREVILLE.</h3>

<p>While connexions thus various, literary, classical,
noble, and professional, incidentally occurred, combatting
the deadening toil of the copyist, and keeping
his mind in tune for intellectual pursuits and attainments,
new scenes, most unexpectedly, opened to
him the world at large, and suddenly brought him
to a familiar acquaintance with high life.</p>

<p>Fulk Greville, a descendant of <i>The Friend of
Sir Philip Sydney</i>, and afterwards author of Characters,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 25]</span>

Maxims, and Reflections, was then generally
looked up to as the finest gentleman about town.
His person, tall and well-proportioned, was commanding;
his face, features, and complexion, were
striking for masculine beauty; and his air and
carriage were noble with conscious dignity.</p>

<p>He was then in the towering pride of healthy
manhood and athletic strength. He excelled in all
the fashionable exercises, riding, fencing, hunting,
shooting at a mark, dancing, tennis, &amp;c.; and
worked at every one of them with a fury for pre-eminence,
not equalled, perhaps, in ardour for superiority
in personal accomplishments, since the days
of the chivalrous Lord Herbert of Cherbury.</p>

<p>His high birth, and higher expectation&mdash;for a
coronet at that time, from some uncertain right of
heritage, hung almost suspended over his head&mdash;with
a splendid fortune, wholly unfettered, already in
his hands, gave to him a consequence in the circles
of modish dissipation that, at the clubs of St. James’s-street,
and on the race ground at Newmarket, nearly
crowned him as chief. For though there were many
competitors of more titled importance, and more
powerful wealth, neither the blaze of their heraldry,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 26]</span>

nor the weight of their gold, could preponderate, in
the buckish scales of the day, over the elegance of
equipment, the grandeur, yet attraction of demeanour,
the supercilious brow, and the resplendent
smile, that marked the lofty yet graceful descendant
of Sir Philip Sydney.</p>

<p>This gentleman one morning, while trying a new
instrument at the house of Kirkman, the first harpsichord
maker of the times, expressed a wish to
receive musical instruction from some one who had
mind and cultivation, as well as finger and ear;
lamenting, with strong contempt, that, in the musical
tribe, the two latter were generally dislocated
from the two former; and gravely asking Kirkman
whether he knew any young musician who was fit
company for a gentleman.</p>

<p>Kirkman, with honest zeal to stand up for the
credit of the art by which he prospered, and which
he held to be insulted by this question, warmly
answered that he knew many; but, very particularly,
one member of the harmonic corps, who had
as much music in his tongue as in his hands, and
who was as fit company for a prince as for an
orchestra.</p>

<p>Mr. Greville, with much surprise, made sundry

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 27]</span>

and formal inquiries into the existence, situation,
and character of what he called so great a phenomenon;
protesting there was nothing he so much
desired as the extraordinary circumstance of finding
any union of sense with sound.</p>

<p>The replies of the good German were so exciting,
as well as satisfactory, that Mr. Greville became
eager to see the youth thus extolled; but charged
Mr. Kirkman not to betray a word of what had
passed, that the interview might be free from restraint,
and seem to be arranged merely for shewing
off the several instruments that were ready for sale,
to a gentleman who was disposed to purchase one of
the most costly.</p>

<p>To this injunction Mr. Kirkman agreed, and conscientiously
adhered.</p>

<p>A day was appointed, and the meeting took
place.</p>

<p>Young Burney, with no other idea than that of
serving Kirkman, immediately seated himself at an
instrument, and played various pieces of Geminiani,
Corelli, and Tartini, whose compositions were then
most in fashion. But Mr. Greville, secretly suspicious
of some connivance, coldly and proudly
walked about the room; took snuff from a finely

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 28]</span>

enamelled snuff-box, and looked at some prints, as
if wholly without noticing the performance.</p>

<p>He had, however, too much penetration not to
perceive his mistake, when he remarked the incautious
carelessness with which his inattention was returned;
for soon, conceiving himself to be playing
to very obtuse ears, young Burney left off all attempt
at soliciting their favour; and only sought his own
amusement by trying favourite passages, or practising
difficult ones, with a vivacity which shewed
that his passion for his art rewarded him in itself
for his exertions. But coming, at length, to keys of
which the touch, light and springing, invited his
stay, he fired away in a sonata of Scarlatti’s, with an
alternate excellence of execution and expression, so
perfectly in accord with the fanciful flights of that
wild but masterly composer, that Mr. Greville, satisfied
no scheme was at work to surprise or to win
him; but, on the contrary, that the energy of genius
was let loose upon itself, and enjoying, without premeditation,
its own lively sports and vagaries; softly
drew a chair to the harpsichord, and listened, with
unaffected earnestness, to every note.</p>

<p>Nor were his ears alone curiously awakened; his
eyes were equally occupied to mark the peculiar

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 29]</span>

performance of intricate difficulties; for the young
musician had invented a mode of adding neatness to
brilliancy, by curving the fingers, and rounding the
hand, in a manner that gave them a grace upon the
keys quite new at that time, and entirely of his own
devising.</p>

<p>To be easily pleased, however, or to make acknowledgment
of being pleased at all, seems derogatory
to strong self-importance; Mr. Greville,
therefore, merely said, “You are fond, Sir, it
seems, of Italian music?”</p>

<p>The reply to this was striking up, with all the
varying undulations of the crescendo, the diminuendo,
the pealing swell, and the “dying, dying
fall,” belonging to the powers of the pedal, that
most popular masterpiece of Handel’s, the Coronation
Anthem.</p>

<p>This quickness of comprehension, in turning from
Italian to German, joined to the grandeur of the
composition, and the talents of the performer, now
irresistibly vanquished Mr. Greville; who, convinced
of Kirkman’s truth with regard to the harmonic
powers of this son of Apollo, desired next to sift
it with regard to the wit.</p>

<p>Casting off, therefore, his high reserve, with his

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 30]</span>

jealous surmises, he ceased to listen to the music,
and started some theme that was meant to lead to
conversation.</p>

<p>But as this essay, from not knowing to what the
youth might be equal, consisted of such inquiries
as, “Have you been in town long, Sir?” or, “Does
your taste call you back to the country, Sir?” &amp;c.
&amp;c., his young hearer, by no means preferring this
inquisitorial style to the fancy of Scarlatti, or the
skill and depth of Handel, slightly answered, “Yes,
Sir,” or “No, Sir;” and, perceiving an instrument
not yet tried, darted to it precipitately, and seated
himself to play a voluntary.</p>

<p>The charm of genuine simplicity is nowhere more
powerful than with the practised and hackneyed
man of the world; for it induces what, of all things,
he most rarely experiences, a belief in sincerity.</p>

<p>Mr. Greville, therefore, though thwarted, was not
displeased; for in a votary of the art he was pursuing,
he saw a character full of talents, yet without
guile; and conceived, from that moment, an idea
that it was one he might personally attach. He
remitted, therefore, to some other opportunity, a
further internal investigation.</p>

<p>Mr. Kirkman now came forward to announce,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 31]</span>

that in the following week he should have a new
harpsichord, with double keys, and a deepened bass,
ready for examination.</p>

<p>They then parted, without any explanation on
the side of Mr. Greville; or any idea on that of
the subject of these memoirs, that he and his acquirements
were objects of so peculiar a speculation.</p>

<p>At the second interview, young Burney innocently
and eagerly flew at once to the harpsichord,
and tried it with various recollections from his
favourite composers.</p>

<p>Mr. Greville listened complacently and approvingly;
but, at the end of every strain, made a speech
that he intended should lead to some discussion.</p>

<p>Young Burney, however, more alive to the graces
of melody than to the subtleties of argument, gave
answers that always finished with full-toned chords,
which as constantly modulated into another movement;
till Mr. Greville, tired and impatient, suddenly
proposed changing places, and trying the
instrument himself.</p>

<p>He could not have devised a more infallible expedient
to provoke conversation; for he thrummed
his own chosen bits by memory with so little skill
or taste, yet with a pertinacity so wearisome, that

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 32]</span>

young Burney, who could neither hearken to such
playing, nor turn aside from such a player, caught
with alacrity at every opening to discourse, as an
acquittal from the fatigue of mock attention.</p>

<p>This eagerness gave a piquancy to what he said,
that stole from him the diffidence that might otherwise
have hung upon his inexperience; and endued
him with a courage for uttering his opinions, that
might else have faded away under the trammels of
distant respect.</p>

<p>Mr. Greville, however, was really superior to the
mawkish parade of unnecessary etiquette in private
circles, where no dignity can be offended, and
no grandeur be let down by suffering nature, wit,
or accident to take their bent, and run their race,
unfettered by punctilio.</p>

<p>Yet was he the last of men to have borne any
designed infringement upon the long established
claims of birth, rank, or situation; which, in fact,
is rarely practised but to lead to a succession of
changes, that circulate, like the names written in a
round robin, to end just where they began;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center smaller">“Such chaos, where degree is suffocate,</p>
<p class="sig-left30 smaller">Follows the choaking.”<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>In the subject of these memoirs, this effervescence
of freedom was clearly that of juvenile artlessness and
overflowing vivacity; and Mr. Greville desired too
sincerely to gather the youth’s notions and fathom
his understanding, for permitting himself to check
such amusing spirits, by proudly wrapping himself
up, as at less favourable moments he was wont to do,
in his own consequence. He grew, therefore, so
lively and entertaining, that young Burney became
as much charmed with his company as he had been
wearied by his music; and an interchange of ideas
took place, as frankly rapid, equal, and undaunted,
as if the descendant of <i>the friend of Sir Philip
Sydney</i> had encountered a descendant of Sir Philip
Sydney himself.</p>

<p>This meeting concluded the investigation; music,
singing her gay triumph, took her stand at the
helm; and a similar victory for capacity and information
awaited but a few intellectual skirmishes,
on poetry, politics, morals, and literature,&mdash;in the
midst of which Mr. Greville, suddenly and gracefully
holding out his hand, fairly acknowledged his
scheme, proclaimed its success, and invited the unconscious
victor to accompany him to Wilbury House.</p>

<p>The amazement of young Burney was boundless;

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 34]</span>

but his modesty, or rather his ignorance that not
to think highly of his own abilities merited that
epithet, was most agreeably surprised by so complicate
a flattery to his character, his endowments,
and his genius.</p>

<p>But his articles with Dr. Arne were in full force;
and it was not without a sigh that he made known
his confined position.</p>

<p>Unaccustomed to control his inclinations himself,
or to submit to their control from circumstances,
expense, or difficulty, Mr. Greville mocked this
puny obstacle; and, instantly visiting Dr. Arne in
person, demanded his own terms for liberating his
Cheshire pupil.</p>

<p>Dr. Arne, at first, would listen to no proposition;
protesting that a youth of such promise was beyond
all equivalent. But no sooner was a round sum
mentioned, than the Doctor, who, in common with
all the dupes of extravagance, was evermore needy,
could not disguise from himself that he was dolorously
out of cash; and the dazzling glare of three
hundred pounds could not but play most temptingly
in his sight, for one of those immediate, though
imaginary wants, that the man of pleasure is always
sure to see waving, with decoying allurement, before
his longing eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>The articles, therefore, were cancelled: and young Burney was
received in the house of Mr. Greville as a desired inmate, a talented
professor, and a youth of genius: to which appellations, from his
pleasantry, gaiety, reading, and readiness, was soon superadded
the title&mdash;not of a humble, but of a chosen and confidential
companion.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Young Burney now moved in a completely new
sphere, and led a completely new life. All his leisure
nevertheless was still devoted to improvement in his
own art, by practice and by composition. But the
hours for such sage pursuits were soon curtailed from
half the day to its quarter; and again from that to
merely the early morning that preceded any communication
with his gay host: for so partial grew
Mr. Greville to his new favourite, that, speedily,
there was no remission of claim upon his time or
his talents, whether for music or discourse.</p>

<p>Nor even here ended the requisition for his presence;
his company had a charm that gave a zest
to whatever went forward: his opinions were so ingenious,
his truth was so inviolate, his spirits were
so entertaining, that, shortly, to make him a part

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 36]</span>

of whatever was said or done, seemed necessary to
Mr. Greville for either speech or action.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">GAMING CLUBS.</h3>

<p>The consequence of this taste for his society
carried young Burney into every scene of high dissipation
which, at that period, made the round of
the existence of a buckish fine gentleman; and he
was continually of the party at White’s, at Brookes’s,
and at every other superfine club house, whether
public or private, to which the dangerous allurement
of gaming, or the scarcely less so of being
<i lang="fr">&agrave; la mode</i>, tempted his fashionable patron.</p>

<p>As Mr. Greville uniformly, whether at cards,
dice, or betting, played with Honour, his success,
of course, was precarious; but as he never was so
splendidly prosperous as to suffer himself to be
beguiled out of all caution; nor yet so frequently
unfortunate as to be rendered desperate, he was
rarely distressed, though now and then he might
be embarrassed.</p>

<p>At these clubs, the subject of these memoirs witnessed
scenes that were ever after rivetted on his
memory. Cards, betting, dice, opened every nocturnal

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 37]</span>

orgie with an <i lang="fr">&eacute;clat</i> of expectation, hope,
ardour, and fire, that seemed to cause a mental
inflammation of the feelings and faculties of the
whole assembly in a mass.</p>

<p>On the first night of the entrance of young Burney
into this set, Mr. Greville amused himself with
keeping out of the way, that he might make over
the new comer to what was called the humour of
the thing; so that, by being unknown, he might
be assailed, as a matter of course, for bets, holding
stakes, choosing cards, &amp;c. &amp;c., and become initiated
in the arcana of a modish gaming house; while
watchful, though apart, Mr. Greville enjoyed, with
high secret glee, the novelty of the youth’s confusion.</p>

<p>But young Burney had the native good sense to
have observed already, that a hoax soon loses its
power of ridicule where it excites no alarm in its
object. He gaily, therefore, treated as a farce every
attempt to bring him forward, and covered up his
real ignorance upon such subjects by wilful blunders
that apparently doubled it; till, by making
himself a pretended caricature of newness and inaptness,
he got, what in coteries of that sort is
always successful, the laugh on his side.</p>

<p>As the evening advanced, the busy hum of common-place

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 38]</span>

chattery subsided; and a general and collected
calmness ensued, such as might best dispose
the gambling associates to a wily deliberation, how
most coolly to penetrate into the mystic obscurities
that brought them together.</p>

<p>All, however, was not yet involved in the gaping
cauldron of chance, whence so soon was to emerge
the brilliant prize, or desolating blank, that was to
blazon the lustre, or stamp the destruction, of whoever,
with his last trembling mite, came to sound its
perilous depths. They as yet played, or prowled
around it, lightly and slightly; not more impatient
than fearful of hurrying their fate; and seeking to
hide from themselves, as well as from their competitors,
their anticipating exultation or dread.</p>

<p>Still, therefore, they had some command of the
general use of their faculties, and of what was due
from them to general social commerce. Still some
vivacious sallies called forth passing smiles from those
who had been seldomest betrayed, or whose fortunes
had least been embezzled; and still such cheeks as
were not too dragged or haggard to exhibit them,
were able to give graceful symptoms of self-possession,
by the pleasing and becoming dimples produced
through arch, though silent observance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>But by degrees the fever of doubt and anxiety
broke forth all around, and every breath caught its
infection. Every look then showed the contagion
of lurking suspicion: every eye that fixed a prosperous
object, seemed to fix it with the stamp of
detection. All was contrast the most discordant,
unblended by any gradation; for wherever the
laughing brilliancy of any countenance denoted
exulting victory, the glaring vacancy of some other
hard by, displayed incipient despair.</p>

<p>Like the awe of death was next the muteness
of taciturnity, from the absorption of agonizing
attention while the last decisive strokes, upon
which hung affluence or beggary, were impending.
Every die, then, became a bliss or a blast; every
extorted word was an execration; every fear
whispered ruin with dishonour; every wish was
a dagger to some antagonist!&mdash;till, finally, the
result was proclaimed, which carried off the winner
in a whirl of maddening triumph; and to the loser
left the recovery of his nervous, hoarse, husky,
grating voice, only for curses and oaths, louder
and more appalling than thunder in its deepest
roll.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">NEWMARKET.</h3>

<p>The next vortex of high dissipation into which,
as its season arrived, young Burney was ushered,
was that of Newmarket: and there, as far as belonged
to the spirit of the race, and the beauty, the
form, and the motions of the noble quadrupeds,
whose rival swiftness made running seem a flight,
and that flight appear an airy game, or gambol, of
some fabled animal of elastic grace and celerity, he
was enchanted with his sojourn. And the accompanying
scenes of gambling, betting, &amp;c., though
of the same character and description as those of
St. James’s-street, he thought less darkly terrible,
because the winners or losers seemed to him more
generally assorted according to their equality in
rank or fortune: though no one, in the long run,
however high, or however low, escaped becoming
the dupe, or the prey, of whoever was most adroit,&mdash;whether
plebeian or patrician.</p>


<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">BATH.</h3>

<p>The ensuing initiation into this mingled existence
of inertness and effort, of luxury and of desolation,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 41]</span>

was made at Bath. But Bath, from its buildings
and its position, had a charm around it for the
subject of these memoirs, to soften off the monotony
of this wayward taste, and these wilful sufferings;
though the seat of dissipation alone he found
to be changed; its basis&mdash;cards, dice, or betting&mdash;being
always the same.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, that beautiful city, then little more
than a splendid village in comparison with its actual
metropolitan size and grandeur, had intrinsic claims
to the most vivid admiration, and the strongest
incitements to youthful curiosity, from the antiquity
of its origin, real as well as fabulous; from its
Bladud, its baths, its cathedral; and its countless
surrounding glories of military remains; all magically
followed up, to vary impression, and stimulate
approbation, by its rising excellence in Grecian
and Roman architecture.</p>

<p>Born with an enthusiastic passion for rural
scenery, the picturesque view of this city offered
to the ravished eye of young Burney some new
loveliness, or striking effect, with an endless enchantment
of variety, at almost every fresh opening
of every fresh street into which he sauntered.</p>

<p>And here, not only did he find this perpetual,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 42]</span>

yet changeful, prospect of Nature in her most
smiling attire, and of Art in her most chaste and
elegant constructions; Bath had yet further attraction
to its new visitor; another captivation stronger
still to a character soaring to intellectual heights,
caught him in its chains,&mdash;it was that of literary
eminence; Bath, at this moment, being illumined
by that sparkling but dangerous Meteor of philosophy,
politics, history, and metaphysics, St. John,
Lord Bolingbroke.</p>

<p>Happily, perhaps, for his safety, it was in vain
that young Burney struggled, by every effort of ingenuity
he could exert, to bask in the radiance of this
Meteor’s wit and eloquence. Every attempt at that
purpose failed; and merely a glimpse of this extraordinary
personage, was all that the utmost vigilance
of romantic research ever caught.</p>

<p>Young Burney could not, at that period, have
studied the works of Lord Bolingbroke, who was
then chiefly known by his political honours and
disgraces; his exile and his pardon; and by that
most perfect panegyric that ever, perhaps, poet
penned, of Pope:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse-first-line">“Come then, my friend! my Genius!&mdash;&mdash;</div>
    <div class="verse">Oh, master of the poet and the song!”</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>Fortunately, therefore, the ingenuous youth and
inexperience of the subject of these memoirs, escaped
the brilliant poison of metaphysical sophistry, that
might else have disturbed his peace, and darkened
his happiness.</p>

<p>The set to which Mr. Greville belonged, was as
little studious to seek, as likely to gain, either for
its advantage or its evil, admission to a character
so eminently scholastic, or so personally fastidious,
as that of Lord Bolingbroke; though, had he been
unhampered by such colleagues, Lord Bolingbroke,
as a metaphysician, would have been sought with
eager, nay, fond alacrity, by Mr. Greville; metaphysics
being, in his own conception and opinion,
the proper bent of his mind and understanding.
But those with whom he now was connected, encompassed
him with snares that left little opening to
any higher pursuits than their own.</p>

<p>The aim, therefore, of young Burney, was soon
limited to obtaining a glance of the still noble,
though infirm figure, and still handsome, though
aged countenance of this celebrated statesman.
And of these, for the most transitory view, he would
frequently, with a book in his hand, loiter by the
hour opposite to his lordship’s windows, which

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 44]</span>

were <i lang="fr">vis &agrave; vis</i> to those of Mr. Greville; or run, in
circular eddies, from side to side of the sedan chair
in which his lordship was carried to the pump-room.</p>

<p>Mr. Greville, though always entertained by the
juvenile eagerness of his young favourite, pursued
his own modish course with the alternate ardour and
apathy, which were then beginning to be what now
is called the order of the day; steering&mdash;for he
thought that was <em>the thing</em>&mdash;with whatever was
most in vogue, even when it was least to his taste;
and making whatever was most expensive the criterion
for his choice, even in diversions; because
that was what most effectually would exclude plebeian
participation.</p>

<p>And to this lofty motive, rather than to any
appropriate fondness for its charms, might be attributed,
in its origin, his fervour for gaming; though
gaming, with that poignant stimulus, self-conceit,
which, where calculation tries to battle with chance,
goads on, with resistless force, our designs by our
presumption, soon left wholly in the back ground
every attempt at rivalry by any other species of recreation.</p>

<p>Hunting therefore, shooting, riding, music, drawing,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 45]</span>

dancing, fencing, tennis, horse-racing, the joys
of Bacchus, and numerous other exertions of skill,
of strength, of prowess, and of ingenuity, served but,
ere long, to fill up the annoying chasms by which
these nocturnal orgies were interrupted through the
obtrusion of day.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">FULK GREVILLE.</h3>

<p>Such was the new world into which the subject
of these memoirs was thus abruptly let loose; but,
happily, his good taste was as much revolted as his
morality, against its practices. And his astonishment
at the dreadful night-work that has been
described; so absorbent, concentrating, and fearful,
hung round with such dire prognostics, pursued
with so much fury, or brooded over with such
despondence; never so thoughtlessly wore away as
to deaden his horror of its perils.</p>

<p>Mr. Greville himself, though frequenting these
scenes as an expert and favourite member of the
coteries in which they were enacted, had too real a
sense of right, and too sincere a feeling of humanity,
to intend involving an inexperienced youth in a
passion for the amusements of hazard; or to excite

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 46]</span>

in him a propensity for the dissolute company of
which its followers are composed; who, satiated
with every species of pleasure that is innoxious, are
alive alone to such as can rescue them from ruin,
even though at the fatal price of betraying into its
gulph the associates with whom they chiefly herd.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he gave no warning to young
Burney of danger. Aware that there was no fortune
to lose, he concluded there was no mischief to
apprehend; and, satisfied that the sentiments of the
youth were good, to meddle with his principles
seemed probably a work of supererogation. Without
reflection, therefore, rather than with any project,
he was glad of a sprightly participator, with
whom he could laugh the next morning, at whatever
had been ludicrous over-night; though to utter
either caution or counsel, he would have thought
moralizing, and, consequently, <em>fogrum</em>; a term
which he adopted for whatever speech, action, or
mode of conduct, he disdainfully believed to be
beneath the high <em>ton</em>to which he considered himself
to be born and bred.</p>

<p>From such <em>fogrum</em> sort of work, therefore, he
contemptuously recoiled, deeming it fitted exclusively
for schoolmasters, or for priests.</p>

<hr class="r15" />


<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">WILBURY HOUSE.</h3>

<p>Not solely, however, to public places were the
pleasures, or the magnificence, of Mr. Greville confined.
He visited, with great fondness and great
state, his family seat in Wiltshire; and had the
highest gratification in receiving company there
with splendour, and in awakening their surprise, and
surpassing their expectations, by the spirit and the
changes of their entertainment.</p>

<p>He travelled in a style that was even princely;
not only from his equipages, out-riders, horses, and
liveries, but from constantly having two of his
attendants skilled in playing the French horn. And
these were always stationed to recreate him with
marches and warlike movements, on the outside of
the windows, where he took any repast.</p>

<p>Wilbury House, the seat of Mr. Greville, situated
near Andover, in Wiltshire, was a really pretty
place; but it had a recommendation to those who
possess wealth and taste with superfluous time, far
greater than any actual beauty, by requiring expensive
alterations, and being susceptible of lavish
improvements.</p>

<p>This enhanced all its merits to Mr. Greville, who,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 48]</span>

when out of other employment for his thoughts,
devoted them to avenues, plantations, rising hills,
sinking dales, and unexpected vistas; to each of
which he called upon whatever guests were at his
house, during their creation, for as much astonishment
as applause.</p>

<p>The call, however, was frequently unanswered;
it was so palpable that he was urged to this pursuit
by lassitude rather than pleasure; by flourishing
ostentation rather than by genuine picturesque taste;
so obvious that to draw forth admiration to the
beauties of his grounds, was far less his object than
to stir up wonder at the recesses of his purse; that
the wearied and wary visitor, who had once been
entrapped to follow his footsteps, in echoing his
exclamations of delight at his growing embellishments,
was, ever after, sedulous, when he was with his
workmen and his works, to elude them: though all
alike were happy to again rejoin him at his sports
and at his table; for there he was gay, hospitable, and
pleasing, brilliant in raillery, and full of enjoyment.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">SAMUEL CRISP, ESQ.</h3>

<p>The first entrance of young Burney into Wilbury
House was engraven, ever after it took place, in

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 49]</span>

golden characters of sacred friendship upon his
mind, for there he first met with Mr. Crisp. And as
his acquaintance with Mr. Greville had opened new
roads and pursuits in life to his prospects, that of
Mr. Crisp opened new sources and new energies to
his faculties, for almost every species of improvement.</p>

<p>Mr. Crisp, by birth and education a gentleman,
according to the ordinary acceptation of that word,
was in mind, manners, and habits yet more truly
so, according to the most refined definition of the
appellation, as including honour, spirit, elegance,
language, and grace.</p>

<p>His person and port were distinguished; his
address was even courtly; his face had the embellishment
of a strikingly fine outline; bright, hazel,
penetrating, yet arch eyes; an open front; a noble
Roman nose; and a smile of a thousand varied
expressions.</p>

<p>But all that was external, however attractive,
however full of promise, however impossible to pass
over, was of utterly inferior worth compared with
the inward man; for there he was rare indeed.
Profound in wisdom; sportive in wit; sound in
understanding. A scholar of the highest order; a
critic of the clearest acumen; possessing, with equal

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 50]</span>

delicacy of discrimination, a taste for literature and
for the arts; and personally excelling, as a <i lang="fr">dilettante</i>,
both in music and painting.</p>

<p>It was difficult to discuss any classical or political
work, that his conversation did not impregnate with
more information and more wit than, commonly
speaking, their acutest authors had brought forward.
And such was his knowledge of mankind, that it was
something beyond difficult, it was scarcely even possible,
to investigate any subject requiring worldly
sagacity, in which he did not dive into the abysses
of the minds and the propensities of the principals,
through whom the business was to be transacted, with
a perspicuity so masterly, that while weighing all
that was presented to him, it developed all that
was held back; and fathomed at once the intentions
and the resources of his opponents.</p>

<p>And with abilities thus grand and uncommon
for great and important purposes, if to such he had
been called, he was endowed with discursive powers
for the social circle, the most varied in matter, the
most solid in reasoning, and the most delighting
in gaiety&mdash;or nearly so&mdash;that ever fell to favoured
mortal’s lot.</p>

<p>The subject of these memoirs was but seventeen

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 51]</span>

years of age, when first he had the incalculable
advantage of being attracted to explore this Mine
of wisdom, experience, and accomplishments. His
musical talents, and a sympathy of taste in the choice
of composers, quickly caught the responsive ears of
Mr. Crisp; which vibrated to every passage, every
sound, that the young musician embellished by
graces intuitively his own, either of expression or
execution. And whenever Mr. Crisp could contrive
to retreat, and induce his new Orpheus to retreat,
from the sports of the field, it was even with ardour
that he escaped from the clang of horses and hounds,
to devote whole mornings to the charms,</p>

<div class="topspace1"></div>

<p class="center smaller">Softly sweet, in Lydian measures,</p>

<div class="topspace1"></div>

<p>of harmony. And harmony indeed, in its most
enlarged combinations, united here the player and
the auditor; for they soon discovered that not in
music alone, but in general sentiments, their hearts
were tuned to the same key, and expanded to the
same “concord of sweet sounds.”</p>

<p>The love of music, in Mr. Crisp, amounted to
passion; yet that passion could not have differed
more from modern enthusiasm in that art, if it had
been hatred; since, far from demanding, according

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 52]</span>

to the present mode, every two or three seasons, new
compositions and new composers, his musical taste
and consistency deviated not from his taste and
consistency in literature: and where a composer
had hit his fancy, and a composition had filled him
with delight, he would call for his favourite pieces
of Bach of Berlin, Handel, Scarlatti, or Echard,
with the same reiteration of eagerness that he would
again and again read, hear, or recite chosen passages
from the works of his favourite bards, Shakespeare,
Milton, or Pope.</p>

<p>Mr. Greville was sometimes diverted, and sometimes
nettled, by this double defection; for in whatever
went forward, he loved to be lord of the ascendant:
but Mr. Crisp, whose temper was as unruffled
as his understanding was firm, only smiled at his
friend’s diversion; and from his pique looked away.
Mr. Greville then sought to combat this musical
mania by ridicule, and called upon his companions
of the chase to halloo the recreant huntsman to the
field; affirming that he courted the pipe and the
song, only to avoid clearing a ditch, and elude leaping
a five-barred gate.</p>

<p>This was sufficient to raise the cry against the
delinquent; for Man without business or employment

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 53]</span>

is always disposed to be a censor of his neighbour;
and whenever he thinks his antagonist on the
road to defeat, is always alert to start up for a wit.
Mr. Crisp, therefore, now, was assailed as a renegado
from the chase; as a lounger; a loiterer; scared by
the horses; panic-struck by the dogs; and more fearful
of the deer, than the deer could be of the hunter.</p>

<p>In the well-poized hope, that the less the sportsmen
were answered, the sooner they would be
fatigued and depart, Mr. Crisp now and then gave
them a nod, but never once a word; even though
this forbearance instigated a triumph, loud, merry,
and exulting; and sent them off, and brought them
back, in the jovial persuasion that, in their own
phrase, they had dumb-founded him.</p>

<p>With this self-satisfied enjoyment, Mr. Crisp
unresistingly indulged them; though with a single
pointed sentence, he could rapidly have descended
them from their fancied elevation. But, above all
petty pride of superiority in trifles, he never held
things of small import to be worth the trouble of an
argument. Still less, however, did he choose to be
put out of his own way; which he always pursued with
placid equanimity whenever it was opposed without
irrefragable reason. Good-humouredly, however,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 54]</span>

he granted to his adversaries, in whose laughs and
railing he sometimes heartily joined, the full play
of their epigrams; internally conscious that, if
seriously provoked, he could retort them by lampoons.
Sometimes, nevertheless, when he was hard
beset by gibes and jeers at his loss of sport; or by
a chorus of mock pitiers shouting out, “Poor Crisp!
poor fellow! how consumedly thou art moped!”
he would quietly say, with a smile of inexpressible
archness, “Go to, my friends, go to! go you your
way, and let me go mine! And pray, don’t be
troubled for me; depend upon it there is nobody
will take more care of Samuel Crisp than I will!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In this manner, and in these sets, rapidly, gaily,
uncounted, and untutored, glided on imperceptibly
the first youth of the subject of these memoirs:
surrounded by temptations to luxury, expense, and
dangerous pleasures, that, in weaker intellects, might
have sapped for ever the foundations of religion and
virtue. But a love of right was the predominant
feature of the mind of young Burney. Mr. Greville,
also, himself, with whatever mockery he would have
sneered away any expression tending either to

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 55]</span>

practice or meditation in piety, instinctively held
in esteem whatever was virtuous; and what was
vicious in scorn: though his esteem for virtue was
never pronounced, lest it should pass for pedantry;
and his scorn for vice was studiously disguised, lest
he should be set down himself for a Fogrum.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">MISS FANNY MACARTNEY.</h3>

<p>New scenes, and of deeper interest, presented
themselves ere long. A lovely female, in the
bloom of youth, equally high in a double celebrity,
the most rarely accorded to her sex, of beauty and
of wit, and exquisite in her possession of both,
made an assault upon the eyes, the understanding,
and the heart of Mr. Greville; so potent in its first
attack, and so varied in its after stages, that, little
as he felt at that time disposed to barter his boundless
liberty, his desultory pursuits, and his brilliant,
though indefinite expectations, for a bondage so
narrow, so derogatory to the swing of his wild will,
as that of marriage appeared to him; he was caught
by so many charms, entangled in so many inducements,
and inflamed by such a whirl of passions,
that he soon almost involuntarily surrendered to the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 56]</span>

besieger; not absolutely at discretion, but very
unequivocally from resistless impulse.</p>

<p>This lady was Miss Fanny Macartney, the third
daughter of Mr. Macartney, a gentleman of large
fortune, and of an ancient Irish family.</p>

<p>In Horace Walpole’s Beauties, Miss Fanny
Macartney was the Flora.</p>

<p>In Greville’s Maxims, Characters, and Reflections,
she was also Flora, contrasted with Camilla, who
was meant for Mrs. Garrick.</p>

<p>Miss Fanny Macartney was of a character which,
at least in its latter stages, seems to demand two
pencils to delineate; so diversely was it understood,
or appreciated.</p>

<p>To many she passed for being pedantic, sarcastic,
and supercilious: as such, she affrighted the timid,
who shrunk into silence; and braved the bold, to
whom she allowed no quarter. The latter, in truth,
seemed to stimulate exertions which brought her
faculties into play; and which&mdash;besides creating
admiration in all who escaped her shafts&mdash;appeared
to offer to herself a mental exercise, useful to her
health, and agreeable to her spirits.</p>

<p>Her understanding was truly masculine; not from
being harsh or rough, but from depth, soundness, and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 57]</span>

capacity; yet her fine small features, and the whole
style of her beauty, looked as if meant by Nature
for the most feminine delicacy: but her voice,
which had something in it of a croak; and her
manner, latterly at least, of sitting, which was that
of lounging completely at her ease, in such curves as
she found most commodious, with her head alone
upright; and her eyes commonly fixed, with an
expression rather alarming than flattering, in examination
of some object that caught her attention;
probably caused, as they naturally excited, the hard
general notion to her disadvantage above mentioned.</p>

<p>This notion, nevertheless, though almost universally
harboured in the circle of her public acquaintance,
was nearly reversed in the smaller circles that
came more in contact with her feelings. By this
last must be understood, solely, the few who were
happy enough to possess her favour; and to them
she was a treasure of ideas and of variety. The
keenness of her satire yielded its asperity to the zest
of her good-humour, and the kindness of her heart.
Her noble indifference to superior rank, if placed in
opposition to superior merit; and her delight in
comparing notes with those with whom she desired
to balance opinions, established her, in her own

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 58]</span>

elected set, as one of the first of women. And
though the fame of her beauty must pass away in
the same oblivious rotation which has withered that
of her rival contemporaries, the fame of her intellect
must ever live, while sensibility may be linked with
poetry, and the Ode to Indifference shall remain to
shew their union.</p>

<p>The various incidents that incited and led to the
connexion that resulted from this impassioned opening,
appertain to the history of Mr. Greville; but, in
its solemn ratification, young Burney took a part so
essential, as to produce a striking and pleasing consequence
to much of his after-life.</p>

<p>The wedding, though no one but the bride and
bridegroom themselves knew why, was a stolen one;
and kept profoundly secret; which, notwithstanding
the bride was under age, was by no means, at that
time, difficult, the marriage act having not yet
passed. Young Burney, though the most juvenile
of the party, was fixed upon to give the lady away;<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
which evinced a trust and a partiality in the bridegroom,
that were immediately adopted by his fair

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 59]</span>

partner; and by her unremittingly sustained, with
the frankest confidence, and the sincerest esteem,
through the whole of a long and varied life. With
sense and taste such as hers, it was not, indeed,
likely she should be slack to discern and develop a
merit so formed to meet their perceptions.</p>

<p>When the new married pair went through the
customary routine of matrimonial elopers, namely,
that of returning home to demand pardon and a
blessing, Mr. Macartney coolly said: “Mr. Greville
has chosen to take a wife out of the window, whom
he might just as well have taken out of the door.”</p>

<p>The immediate concurrence of the lovely new
mistress of Wilbury House, in desiring the society,
even more than enjoying the talents, of her lord and
master’s favourite, occasioned his residence there to
be nearly as unbroken as their own. And the whole
extensive neighbourhood so completely joined in
this kindly partiality, that no engagement, no assemblage
whatsoever took place, from the most
selectly private, to the most gorgeously public, to
which the Grevilles were invited, in which he was
not included: and he formed at that period many
connections of lasting and honourable intimacy;
particularly with Dr. Hawkesworth, Mr. Boone,
and Mr. Cox.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>They acted, also, sundry proverbs, interludes, and
farces, in which young Burney was always a principal
personage. In one, amongst others, he played
his part with a humour so entertaining, that its
nick-name was fastened upon him for many years
after its appropriate representation. It would be
difficult, indeed, not to accord him theatrical talents,
when he could perform with success a character
so little congenial with his own, as that of a
finical, conceited coxcomb, a paltry and illiterate
poltroon; namely, Will Fribble, Esq., in Garrick’s
farce of Miss in her Teens. Mr. Greville himself was
Captain Flash, and the beautiful Mrs. Greville was
Miss Biddy Bellair; by which three names, from the
great diversion their adoption had afforded, they corresponded
with one another during several years.</p>

<p>The more serious honour that had been conferred
upon young Burney, of personating the part of
father to Mrs. Greville, was succeeded, in due season
after these gay espousals, by that of personating
the part of god-father to her daughter; in standing,
as the representative of the Duke of Beaufort, at
the baptism of Miss Greville, afterwards the all-admired,
and indescribably beautiful Lady Crewe.</p>

<p>Little could he then foresee, that he was bringing

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 61]</span>

into the christian community a permanent blessing
for his own after-life, in one of the most cordial,
confidential, open-hearted, and unalterable of his
friends.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">ESTHER.</h3>

<p>But not to Mr. Greville alone was flung one of
those blissful or baneful darts, that sometimes fix
in a moment, and irreversibly, the domestic fate of
man; just such another, as potent, as pointed, as
piercing, yet as delicious, penetrated, a short time
afterwards, the breast of young Burney; and from
eyes perhaps as lovely, though not as celebrated;
and from a mind perhaps as highly gifted, though
not as renowned.</p>

<p>Esther Sleepe&mdash;this memorialist’s mother&mdash;of
whom she must now with reverence, with fear&mdash;yet
with pride and delight&mdash;offer the tribute of a description&mdash;was
small and delicate, but not diminutive,
in person. Her face had that sculptural oval form
which gives to the air of the head something like
the ideal perfection of the poet’s imagination. Her
fair complexion was embellished by a rosy hue upon
her cheeks of Hebe freshness. Her eyes were of
the finest azure, and beaming with the brightest

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 62]</span>

intelligence; though they owed to the softness of
their lustre a still more resistless fascination: and
they were set in her head with such a peculiarity
of elegance in shape and proportion, that they imparted
a nobleness of expression to her brow and to
her forehead, that, whether she were beheld when
attired for society; or surprised under the negligence
of domestic avocation; she could be viewed
by no stranger whom she did not strike with admiration;
she could be broken in upon by no old
friend who did not look at her with new pleasure.</p>

<p>It was at a dance that she first was seen by
young Burney, at the house of his elder brother,
in Hatton Garden; and that first sight was to
him decisive, for he was not more charmed by
her beauty than enchanted by her conversation.</p>

<p>So extraordinary, indeed, were the endowments
of her mind, that, her small opportunity for their
attainment considered, they are credible only from
having been known upon proof.</p>

<p>Born in the midst of the city&mdash;but not in one
of those mansions where, formerly,<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 63]</span>

luxury and riches revelled with a lavish preponderance
of magnificence, that left many of those of the nobles of
the west plain or old-fashioned in comparison: not
in one of those dwellings of the hospitable English
merchant of early days, whose boundless liberality
brought tributary under his roof the arts and sciences,
in the persons of their professors; and who
rivalled the nobles in the accomplishments of their
progeny, till, by mingling in acquirements, they
mingled in blood:&mdash;the birth of the lovely Esther
had nothing to boast from parental dignity, parental
opulence, nor&mdash;strange, and stranger yet
to tell&mdash;parental worth.</p>

<p>Alone stood the lovely Esther, unsustained by
ancestry, unsupported by wealth, unimpelled by
family virtue&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Yet no!&mdash;in this last article there was a partnership
that redeemed the defection, since the Male
parent was not more wanting in goodness, probity,
and conduct, than the Female was perfect in all&mdash;if
perfect were a word that, without presumption,
might ever be applied to a human being.</p>

<p>With no advantage, therefore, of education, save
the simple one of early learning, or, rather, imbibing
the French language, from her maternal grandfather,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 64]</span>

who was a native of France, but had been
forced from his country by the edict of Nantz;
this gifted young creature was one of the most
pleasing, well-mannered, well-read, elegant, and
even cultivated, of her sex: and wherever she
appeared in a social circle, and was drawn forth&mdash;which
the attraction of her beauty made commonly
one and the same thing&mdash;she was generally
distinguished as the first female of the party for
sense, literature, and, rarer still, for judgment;
a pre-eminence, however, not more justly, than,
by herself, unsuspectedly her due; for, more than
unassuming, she was ignorant of her singular superiority.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>To excel in music, or in painting, so as to rival
even professors, save the highest, in those arts, had
not then been regarded as the mere ordinary progress
of female education: nor had the sciences yet
become playthings for the nursery. These new
roads of ambition for juvenile eminence are undoubtedly

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 65]</span>

improvements, where they leave not out
more essential acquirements. Yet, perhaps, those
who were born before this elevation was the mode;
whose calls, therefore, were not so multitudinous
for demonstrative embellishments, may be presumed
to have risen to more solid advantages in mental
attainments, and in the knowledge and practice
of domestic duties, than the super-accomplished
aspirants at excellence in a mass, of the present
moment.</p>

<p>A middle course might, perhaps, be more intellectually
salubrious, because more simple and natural:
and foremost herself, if she may be judged by
analogy, foremost herself, had stood this lovely
Esther, in amalgamating the two systems in her
own studies and pursuits, had they equally, at
that time, been within the scope of her consciousness:
for straight-forward as was her design
in all that she deemed right, whatever was presented
to even a glimpse of her perceptions that
was new and ingenious, rapidly opened to her
lively understanding a fresh avenue to something
curious, useful, or amusing, that she felt herself
irresistibly invited to explore.</p>

<p>Botany, then, was no familiar accomplishment;
but flowers and plants she cultivated with assiduous

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 66]</span>

care; sowing, planting, pruning, grafting, and
rearing them, to all the purposes of sight and scent
that belong to their fragrant enjoyment; though
untutored in their nomenclature, and unlearned in
their classification.</p>

<p>Astronomy, though beyond her grasp as a science,
she passionately caught at in its elementary visibility,
loving it for its intrinsic glory, and enamoured
of it yet more fondly from her own favourite idea,
that the soul of the righteous, upon the decease of
the body, may be wafted to realms of light, and
permitted thence to look down, as guardian angel,
on those most precious to it left behind.</p>

<p>Yet so strict was her sense of duty, that she never
suffered this vivid imagination to put it out of its
bias; and the clearness of her judgment regulated
so scrupulously the disposition of her hours, that,
without neglecting any real devoir, she made leisure,
by skilful arrangements and quickness of
execution, for nearly every favourite object that hit
her fancy; holding almost as sacred the employment
of her spare moments, as most others hold
the fulfilment of their stated occupations.</p>

<p>And, indeed, so only could she, thus self-taught
by self-investigation, study, and labour, have risen
to those various excellences that struck all who

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 67]</span>

saw, and impressed all who knew her, with admiration
mingled with wonder.</p>

<p>Critical was the first instant of meeting between
two young persons thus similarly self-modelled, and
thus singularly demonstrating, that Education, with
all her rules, her skill, her experienced knowledge,
and her warning wisdom, may so be supplied, be
superseded, by Genius, when allied to Industry, as
to raise beings who merit to be pointed out as
examples, even to those who have not a difficulty
to combat, who are spurred by encouragement,
and instructed by able teachers; to all which
advantages young Burney and Esther&mdash;though as
far removed from distress as from affluence&mdash;were
equally strangers.</p>

<p>Who shall be surprised that two such beings,
thus opening into life and distinction through intellectual
vigour, and thus instinctively sustaining
unaided conflicts against the darkness of ignorance,
the intricacies of new doctrines, and all the
annoying obstructions of early prejudices,&mdash;who
shall be surprised, that two such beings, where,
on one side, there was so much beauty to attract,
and on the other so much discernment to perceive
the value of her votary, upon meeting each other

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 68]</span>

at the susceptible age of ardent youth, should have
emitted, spontaneously, and at first sight, from
heart to heart, sparks so bright and pure that
they might be called electric, save that their flame
was exempt from any shock?</p>

<p>Young Burney at this time had no power to sue
for the hand, though he had still less to forbear suing
for the heart, of this fair creature: not only he had
no fortune to lay at her feet, no home to which
he could take her, no prosperity which he could
invite her to share; another barrier, which seemed
to him still more formidable, stood imperviously
in his way&mdash;his peculiar position with Mr. Greville.</p>

<p>That gentleman, in freeing the subject of these
memoirs from his engagements with Dr. Arne,
meant to act with as much kindness as munificence;
for, casting aside all ostentatious parade, he had
shown himself as desirous to gain, as to become,
a friend. Yet was there no reason to suppose he
purposed to rear a vine, of which he would not
touch the grapes.</p>

<p>To be liberal, suited at once the real good taste
of his character, and his opinion of what was due
to his rank in life; and in procuring to himself the
double pleasure of the society and the talents of

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 69]</span>

young Burney, he thought his largess to Dr. Arne
well bestowed; but it escaped his reflections, that
the youth whom he made his companion in London,
at Wilbury House, at Newmarket, and at Bath, in
quitting the regular pursuit of his destined profession,
risked forfeiting the most certain guarantee to
prosperity in business, progressive perseverance.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, those drawbacks to this splendid
connection occurred not at its beginning, nor yet
for many a day after, to the young votary of Apollo.
The flattering brilliancy of the change, and the sort
of romance that hung upon its origin, kept aloof all
calculations of its relative mischiefs; which only
distantly to have contemplated, in the sparkling
novelty that mingled such gay pleasure with his
gratitude, would have appeared to him ungenerous,
if not sordid. Youth is rarely enlightened by foresight
upon prudential prospects; and the mental
optic of young Burney was not quickened to this
perception, till the desire of independence to his
fortune was excited by the loss of it to his heart;
for never had he missed his liberty, till he sighed to
make it a fresh sacrifice to a more lasting bondage.</p>

<p>It was then he first felt the torment of uncertain
situation; it was then he appreciated the high male

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 70]</span>

value of self-dependence; it was then he first conceived,
that, though gaiety may be found, and
followed, and met, and enjoyed abroad, not there,
but at home, is happiness! Yet, from the moment
a bosom whisper softly murmured to him the name
of Esther, he had no difficulty to believe in the distinct
existence of happiness from pleasure; and&mdash;still
less to devise where&mdash;for him&mdash;it must be sought.</p>

<p>When he made known to his fair enslaver his singular
position, and entreated her counsel to disentangle
him from a net, of which, till now, the soft
texture had impeded all discernment of the confinement,
the early wisdom with which she preached to
him patience and forbearance, rather diminished
than augmented his power of practising either, by
an increase of admiration that doubled the eagerness
of his passion.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he was fain to comply with her
counsel, though less from acquiescence than from
helplessness how to devise stronger measures, while
under this nameless species of obligation to Mr.
Greville, which he could not satisfy his delicacy in
breaking; nor yet, in adhering to, justify his sense
of his own rights.</p>

<p>He could consent, however, to be passive only

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 71]</span>

while awaiting some happy turn for propitiating his
efforts to escape from the sumptuous scenes, which,
with his heart away from them, he now looked upon
as obscuring, not illuminating, his existence; since
they promoted not the means of arriving at all he
began to hold worth pursuit, “Home, sweet home!”
which he now severely saw could be reached only
by regular assiduity in his profession.</p>

<p>From this time it was with difficulty he could
assume spirit sufficient for sustaining his intercourse,
hitherto so happy, so lively, with the Grevilles; not
alone from the sufferings of absence, but from hard
secret conflicts, whether or not to reveal his distress.
Mr. Greville, who, a short time back would quickly
have discerned his latent uneasiness, was now so
occupied by his own new happiness, conjugal and
paternal, that though he welcomed young Burney
with unabated kindness, his own thoughts, and his
observations, were all centered in his two Fannys.</p>

<p>During the first fair breathings of early wedded
love, the scoff of the tender passion, the sneer against
romance, the contempt of refined reciprocations of
sentiment, are done away, even from the most
sarcastic, by a newly imbibed consciousness of the
felicity of virtuous tenderness; which were its

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 72]</span>

permanence more frequently equal to its enjoyment,
would irresistibly convert the scorn of its deriders
into envy. But constancy in affection from long dissipated
characters, must always, whether in friendship
or in love, be as rare as it is right; for constancy
requires virtue to be leagued with the passions.</p>

<p>Unmarked, therefore, young Burney kept to
himself his unhappiness; though he was not now
impeded from communication by fears of the raillery
with which, previously to his marriage, Mr. Greville
would have held up to mockery a tale of love in a
cottage, as a proper pendant to a tale of love in
bedlam. But still he was withheld from all genial
confidence, by apprehensions of remonstrances which
he now considered as mercenary, if not derogatory,
against imprudent connexions; and of representations
of his own claims to higher views; which he
now, from his belief that his incomparable choice
would out-balance in excellence all vain attempts
at competition, deemed profane if not insane.</p>

<p>Mrs. Greville, having no clew to his secret feelings,
was not aware of their disturbance; she might
else easily, and she would willingly, have drawn forth
his confidence, from the kindly disposition that subsisted,
on both sides, to trust and to friendship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p>But a discovery the most painful of the perturbed
state of his mind, was soon afterwards impelled by
a change of affairs in the Grevilles, which they
believed would enchant him with pleasure; but
which they found, to their unspeakable astonishment,
overpowered him with affliction.</p>

<p>This was no other than a plan of going abroad
for some years, and of including him in their party.</p>

<p>Concealment was instantly at an end. The sudden
dismay of his ingenuous countenance, though
it told not the cause, betrayed past recall his repugnance
to the scheme.</p>

<p>With parts so lively, powers of observation so
ready, and a spirit so delighting in whatever was
uncommon and curious, they had expected that
such a prospect of visiting new countries, surveying
new scenes, mingling with new characters; and
traversing the foreign world, under their auspices,
in all its splendour, would have raised in him a
buoyant transport, exhilarating to behold. But the
sudden paleness that overspread his face; his downcast
eye; the quiver of his lips; and the unintelligible
stammer of his vainly attempted reply,
excited interrogatories so anxious and so vehement,
that they soon induced an avowal that a secret

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 74]</span>

power had gotten possession of his mind, and
sturdily exiled from it all ambition, curiosity, or
pleasure, that came not in the form of an offering
to its all-absorbing shrine.</p>

<p>Every objection and admonition which he had
anticipated, were immediately brought forward by
this confession; but they were presented with a
lenity that showed his advisers to be fully capable
of conceiving, though persuaded that they ought
to oppose, his feelings.</p>

<p>Disconcerted, as well as dejected, because dissatisfied
as well as unhappy in his situation, from
mental incertitudes what were its real calls; and
whether or not the ties of interest and obligation
were here of sufficient strength to demand the
sacrifice of those of love; he attempted not to
vindicate, unreflectingly, his wishes; and still less
did he permit himself to treat them as his intentions.
With faint smiles, therefore, but stifled sighs, he
heard, with civil attention, their opinions; though,
determined not to involve himself in any embarrassing
conditions, he would risk no reply; and
soon afterwards, curbing his emotion, he started
abruptly another subject.</p>

<div class="topspace1"></div>

<p class="center smaller">“They thought him wise, and followed as he led.”</p>

<div class="topspace1"></div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>All the anguish, however, that was here suppressed,
found vent with redoubled force at the feet
of the fair partner in his disappointment; who,
while unaffectedly sharing it, resolutely declined
receiving clandestinely his hand, though tenderly
she clung to his heart. She would listen to no project
that might lead him to relinquish such solid
friends, at the very moment that they were preparing
to give him the strongest proof of their fondness for
his society, and of their zeal in his benefit and
improvement.</p>

<p>Young Burney was not the less unhappy at this
decision from being sensible of its justice, since his
judgment could not but thank her, in secret, for
pronouncing the hard dictates of his own.</p>

<p>All that he now solicited was her picture, that he
might wear her resemblance next his heart, till that
heart should beat to its responsive original.</p>

<p>With this request she gracefully complied; and
she sat for him to Spencer, one of the most famous
miniature painters of that day.</p>

<p>Of striking likeness was this performance, of which
the head and unornamented hair were executed with
the most chaste simplicity; and young Burney reaped
from this possession all that had power to afford him

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 76]</span>

consolation; since he now could soften off the pangs
of separation, by gliding from company, public places
or assemblages, to commune by himself with the
countenance of all he held most dear.</p>

<p>Thus solaced, he resigned himself with more
courage to his approaching misfortune.</p>

<p>The Grevilles, it is probable, from seeing him
apparently revived, imagined that, awakened from
his flights of fancy, he was recovering his senses:
but when, from this idea, they started, with light
raillery, the tender subject, they found their utter
mistake. The most distant hint of abandoning such
excellence, save for the moment, and from the moment’s
necessity, nearly convulsed him with inward
disturbance; and so changed his whole appearance,
that, concerned as well as amazed, they were
themselves glad to hasten from so piercing a
topic.</p>

<p>Too much moved, however, to regain his equilibrium,
he could not be drawn from a disturbed
taciturnity, till shame, conquering his agitation,
enabled him to call back his self-command. He
forced, then, a laugh at his own emotion; but, presently
afterwards seized with an irresistible desire of
shewing what he thought its vindication, he took

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 77]</span>

from his bosom the cherished miniature, and placed
it, fearfully, almost awfully, upon a table.</p>

<p>It was instantly and eagerly snatched from hand
to hand by the gay couple; and young Burney had
the unspeakable relief of perceiving that this impulsive
trial was successful. With expansive smiles they
examined and discussed the charm of the complexion,
the beauty of the features, and the sensibility and
sweetness conveyed by their expression: and what
was then the joy, the pride of heart, the soul’s
delight of the subject of these memoirs, when those
fastidious judges, and superior self-possessors of personal
attractions, voluntarily and generously united
in avowing that they could no longer wonder at his
captivation.</p>

<p>As a statue he stood fixed before them; a smiling
one, indeed; a happy one; but as breathless, as
speechless, as motionless.</p>

<p>Mr. Greville then, with a laugh, exclaimed, “But
why, Burney, why don’t you marry her?”</p>

<p>Whether this were uttered sportively, inadvertently,
or seriously, young Burney took neither time
nor reflection to weigh; but, starting forward with
ingenuous transport, called out, “May I?”</p>

<p>No negative could immediately follow an interrogatory

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 78]</span>

that had thus been invited; and to have pronounced
one in another minute would have been too
late; for the enraptured and ardent young lover,
hastily construing a short pause into an affirmative,
blithely left them to the enjoyment of their palpable
amusement at his precipitancy; and flew, with
extatic celerity, to proclaim himself liberated from
all mundane shackles, to her with whom he thought
eternal bondage would be a state celestial.</p>

<p>From this period, to that of their exquisitely
happy union,</p>

<div class="topspace1"></div>

<p class="center smaller">“Gallopp’d apace the fiery-footed steeds,”</p>

<div class="topspace1"></div>

<p>that urged on Time with as much gay delight as
prancing rapidity; for if they had not, in their matrimonial
preparations, the luxuries of wealth, neither
had they its fatiguing ceremonies; if they had not
the security of future advantage, they avoided the
torment of present procrastination; and if they had
but little to bestow upon one another, they were
saved, at least, the impatiency of waiting for the
seals, signatures, and etiquettes of lawyers, to bind
down a lucrative prosperity to survivorship.</p>

<p>To the mother of the bride, alone of her family,
was confided, on the instant, this spontaneous, this

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 79]</span>

sudden felicity. Little formality was requisite, before
the passing of the marriage act, for presenting
at the hymeneal altar its destined votaries; and contracts
the most sacred could be rendered indissoluble
almost at the very moment of their projection: a
strange dearth of foresight in those legislators who
could so little weigh the chances of a minor’s judgment
upon what, eventually, may either suit his
taste or form his happiness, for the larger portion of
existence that commonly follows his majority.</p>

<p>This mother of the bride was of a nature so free
from stain, so elementally white, that it would
scarcely seem an hyperbole to denominate her an
angel upon earth&mdash;if purity of mind that breathed to
late old age the innocence of infancy, and sustained
the whole intervening period in the constant practice
of self-sacrificing virtue, with piety for its sole
stimulus, and holy hope for its sole reward, can
make pardonable the hazard of such an anticipating
appellation,&mdash;from which, however, she, her humble
self, would have shrunk as from sacrilege.</p>

<p>She was originally of French extraction, from a
family of the name of Dubois; but though her
father was one of the conscientious victims of the
Edict of Nantz, she, from some unknown cause&mdash;

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 80]</span>

probably of maternal education&mdash;had been brought
up a Roman Catholic. The inborn religion of her
mind, however, counteracted all that was hostile to
her fellow-creatures, in the doctrine of the religion
of her ancestors; and her gentle hopes and fervent
prayers were offered up as devoutly for those whom
she feared were wrong, as they were vented enthusiastically
for those whom she was bred to believe
were right.</p>

<p>Her bridal daughter, who had been educated a Protestant,
and who to that faith adhered steadily and
piously through life, loved her with that devoted love
which could not but emanate from sympathy of excellence.
She was the first pride of her mother,&mdash;or,
rather, the first delight; for pride, under any form,
or through any avenue, direct or collateral, by which
that subtle passion works or swells its way to the
human breast, her mother knew not; though she was
endued with an innate sense of dignity that seemed
to exhale around her a sentiment of reverence that,
notwithstanding her genuine and invariable humility,
guarded her from every species and every
approach of disrespect.</p>

<p>She could not but be gratified by an alliance so
productive, rather than promising, of happiness to

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 81]</span>

her favourite child; and Mr. Burney&mdash;as the married
man must now be called&mdash;soon imbibed the
filial veneration felt by his wife, and loved his
mother-in-law as sincerely as if she had been his
mother-in-blood.</p>

<p>All plan of going abroad was now, of course, at
an end; and the Grevilles, and their beautiful infant
daughter, leaving behind them Benedict the married
man, set out, a family trio, upon their tour.</p>

<p>The customary compliments of introduction on one
hand, and of congratulation on the other, passed, in
their usual forms upon such occasions, between the
bridegroom and his own family.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Rarely can the highest zest of pleasure awaken,
in its most active votary, a sprightliness of pursuit
more gay or more spirited, than Mr. Burney now
experienced and exhibited in the commonly grave
and sober career of business, from the ardour of his
desire to obtain self-dependence.</p>

<p>He worked not, indeed, with the fiery excitement
of expectation; his reward was already in his hands;
but from the nobler impulse he worked of meriting
his fair lot; while she, his stimulus, deemed her

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 82]</span>

own the highest prize from that matrimonial wheel
whence issue bliss or bane to the remnant life of a
sensitive female.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">THE CITY.</h3>

<p>It was in the city, in consequence of his wife’s
connexions, that Mr. Burney made his first essay as
a housekeeper; and with a prosperity that left not
a doubt of his ultimate success. Scholars, in his
musical art, poured in upon him from all quarters of
that British meridian; and he mounted so rapidly
into the good graces of those who were most
opulent and most influential, that it was no sooner
known that there was a vacancy for an organist
professor, in one of the fine old fabrics of devotion
which decorate religion in the city and reflect credit
on our commercial ancestors, than the Fullers, Hankeys,
and all other great houses of the day to which
he had yet been introduced, exerted themselves in
his service with an activity and a warmth that were
speedily successful; and that he constantly recounted
with pleasure.</p>

<p>Anxious to improve as well as to prosper in his
profession, he also elaborately studied composition,
and brought forth several musical pieces; all of

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 83]</span>

which that are authenticated, will be enumerated in
a general list of his musical works.</p>

<p>And thus, with a felicity that made toil delicious,
through labour repaid by prosperity; exertions, by
comfort; fatigue, by soothing tenderness; and all
the fond passions of juvenile elasticity, by the charm
of happiest sympathy,&mdash;began, and were rolling on,
equally blissful and busy, the first wedded years of
this animated young couple;&mdash;when a storm suddenly
broke over their heads, which menaced one of those
deadly catastrophes, that, by engulphing one loved
object in that “bourne whence no traveller returns,”
tears up for ever by the root all genial, spontaneous,
unsophisticated happiness, from the survivor.</p>

<p>Mr. Burney, whether from overstrained efforts in
business; or from an application exceeding his physical
powers in composition; or from the changed
atmosphere of Cheshire, Shropshire, and Wiltshire,
for the confined air of our great and crowded city;
which had not then, as now, by a vast mass of improvement,
been made nearly as sane as it is populous;
suddenly fell, from a state of the most vigorous
health, to one the most alarming, of premature
decay. And to this defalcation of strength was

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 84]</span>

shortly added the seizure of a violent and dangerous
fever that threatened his life.</p>

<p>The sufferings of the young wife, who was now
also a young mother, can only be conceived by contrasting
them with her so recent happiness. Yet
never did she permit grief to absorb her faculties,
nor to vanquish her fortitude. She acted with the
same spirited force of mind, as if she had been a
stranger to the timid terrors of the heart. She superintended
all that was ordered; she executed, where
it was possible, all that was performed; she was
sedulously careful that no business should be neglected;
and her firmness in all that belonged to the
interests of her husband, seemed as invulnerable as
if that had been her sole occupation; though never,
for a moment, was grief away from her side, and
though perpetually, irresistibly she wept,&mdash;for sorrow
with the youthful is always tearful. Yet she
strove to disallow herself that indulgence; refusing
time even for gently wiping from her cheeks the
big drops of liquid anguish which coursed their
way; and only, and hastily, almost with displeasure,
brushing them off with her hand; while resolutely
continuing, or renewing, some useful operation, as
if she were but mechanically engaged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>All this was recorded by her adoring husband in
an elegy of after-times.</p>

<p>The excellent and able Dr. Armstrong, already
the friend of the invalid, was now sent to his aid by
the Hon. and Rev. Mr. Home, who had conceived
the warmest esteem for the subject of these memoirs.
The very sight of this eminent physician was medicinal;
though the torture he inflicted by the blister
after blister with which he deemed it necessary to
almost cover, and almost flay alive, his poor patient,
required all the high opinion in which that patient
held the doctor’s skill for endurance.</p>

<p>The unsparing, but well-poised, prescriptions of this
poetical &AElig;sculapius, succeeded, however, in dethroning
and extirpating the raging fever, that, perhaps,
with milder means, had undermined the sufferer’s
existence. But a consumptive menace ensued, with
all its fearful train of cough, night perspiration,
weakness, glassy eyes, and hectic complexion; and
Dr. Armstrong, foreseeing an evil beyond the remedies
of medicine, strenuously urged an adoption of
their most efficient successor, change of air.</p>

<p>The patient, therefore, was removed to Canonbury-house;
whence, ere long, by the further advice,
nay, injunction, of Dr. Armstrong, he was compelled

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 86]</span>

to retire wholly from London; after an illness by
which, for thirteen weeks, he had been confined to
his bed.</p>

<p>Most fortunately, Mr. Burney, at this time, had
proposals made to him by a Norfolk baronet, Sir
John Turner, who was member for Lynn Regis,
of the place of organist of that royal borough; of
which, for a young man of talents and character, the
Mayor and Corporation offered to raise the salary
from twenty to one hundred pounds a year; with an
engagement for procuring to him the most respectable
pupils from all the best families in the town
and its neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Though greatly chagrined and mortified to quit a
situation in which he now was surrounded by cordial
friends, who were zealously preparing for him all
the harmonical honours which the city holds within
its patronage; the declining health of the invalid,
and the forcibly pronounced opinion of his scientific
medical counsellor, decided the acceptance of this
proposal; and Mr. Burney, with his first restored
strength, set out for his new destination.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 87]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">LYNN REGIS.</h3>

<p>Mr. Burney was compelled to make his first
essay of the air, situation, and promised advantages
of Lynn, without the companion to whom
he owed the re-establishment of health that enabled
him to try the experiment: his Esther, as
exemplary in her maternal as in her conjugal
duties, was now indispensably detained in town by
the most endearing of all ties to female tenderness,
the first offsprings of a union of mutual love;
of which the elder could but just go alone, and
the younger was still in her arms.</p>

<p>Mr. Burney was received at Lynn with every
mark of favour, that could demonstrate the desire
of its inhabitants to attach and fix him to that
spot. He was introduced by Sir John Turner to
the mayor, aldermen, recorder, clergy, physicians,
lawyers, and principal merchants, who formed the
higher population of the town; and who in their
traffic, the wine trade, were equally eminent for
the goodness of their merchandize and the integrity
of their dealings.</p>

<p>All were gratified by an acquisition to their distant
and quiet town, that seemed as propitious to

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 88]</span>

society as to the arts; the men with respect gave
their approbation to his sense and knowledge; the
women with smiles bestowed theirs upon his manners
and appearance. His air was so lively, and
his figure was so youthful, that the most elegant
as well as beautiful woman of the place, Mrs.
Stephen Allen, took him for a Cambridge student,
who, at that time, was expected at Lynn.</p>

<p>He was not insensible to such a welcome; yet
the change was so great from the splendid or
elegant, the classical or amusing circles, into which
he had been initiated in the metropolis, that, in
looking, he said, around him, he seemed to see
but a void.</p>

<p>The following energetic lament to his Esther,
written about a week after his Lynn residence,
will best explain his tormented sensations at this
altered scene of life. He was but in his twenty-fourth
year, when he gave way to this quick burst
of chagrin.</p>

<div class="topspace2"></div>

<blockquote>

<p class="center smcap">“To Mrs. Burney.</p>

<p class="sig-right5">“<i>Lynn Regis, Monday.</i></p>

<p>“Now, my amiable friend, let me unbosom myself to thee,
as if I were to enjoy the incomparable felicity of thy presence.
And first&mdash;let me exclaim at the unreasonableness of man’s

<span class="pagenum-block">[Pg 89]</span>

desires; at his unbounded ambition and avarice, and at the
inconstancy of his temper, which impels him, the moment he
is in the possession of the thing that once employed all his
thoughts and wishes, to relinquish it, and to fix his “mind’s
eye” on some bauble that next becomes his point of view,
and that, if attained, he would wish as much to change for
still another toy, of still less consequence to his interest and
quiet. Oh thou constant tenant of my heart! to apply the
above to myself,&mdash;thou art the only good I have been constant
to! the only blessing I have been thankful to Providence for!
the only one, I feel, I shall ever continue to have a true sense
of! Ought I not to blush at this character’s suiting me?
Indeed I ought, and I do. Not that I think it one peculiar
to myself; I believe it would fit more than half mankind. But
it shames me to think how little I knew myself, when I fancied
I should be happy in this place. Oh God! I find it
impossible I should ever be so. Would you believe it, that I
have more than a hundred times wished I had never heard its
name? Nothing but the hope of acquiring an independent
fortune in a short space of time will keep me here; though
I am too deeply entered to retreat without great loss. But
happiness cannot be too dearly purchased. In short, I would
gladly change again for London, at any rate.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“The organ is execrably bad; and, add to that, a total
ignorance of the most known and common musical merits runs
through the whole body of people I have yet conversed with.
Even Sir J. T., who is the oracle of Apollo in this country,
is, in these matters, extremely shallow. Now the bad organ,
with the ignorance of my auditors, must totally extinguish the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 90]</span>

few sparks of genius for composition that I may have, and
entirely discourage practice; for where would any pains I may
take to execute the most difficult piece of music be repaid, if,
like poor Orpheus, I am to perform to sticks and stones?”</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="topspace2"></div>

<p>Ere long, however, Mr. Burney saw his prospects
in a fairer point of view. He found himself
surrounded by some very worthy and amiable persons,
perfectly disposed to be his friends; and he
became attached to their kindness. The unfixed
state of his health made London a perilous place
of abode for him; and his Esther pleaded for his
accommodating himself to his new situation.</p>

<p>He took, therefore, a pretty and convenient
house, and sent for what, next to his lovely wife, he
most valued, his books; and when they came, and
when she herself was coming, he revived in his
hopes and spirits, and hastened her approach by the
following affectionate rhymes&mdash;they must not, in
these fastidious days, be called verses. The austere
critic is besought, therefore, not to fall on
the fair fame of the writer, by considering them
as produced for public inspection; nor as assuming
the high present character of poetry. They
are inserted only biographically, from a dearth of
any further prose document, by which might be

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 91]</span>

conveyed, in the simplicity of his own veracious
diction, some idea of the sympathy and the purity
of his marriage happiness, by the rare picture which
these lines present of an intellectual lover in a
tender husband.</p>

   <div class="verse indent18">“<i>Lynn Regis, 19th Dec. 1751.</i>”</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<div class="topspace2"></div>

<p>The wife and the babies were soon now in his
arms; and this generous appreciator of the various
charms of the one, and kind protector of the infantile
feebleness of the other, cast away every remnant
of discontent; and devoted himself to his family and
profession, with an ardour that left nothing unattempted
that seemed within the grasp of industry,
and nothing unaccomplished that came within the
reach of perseverance.</p>

<p>He had immediately for his pupils the daughters
of every house in Lynn, whose chief had the smallest
pretensions to belonging to the upper classes of the
town; while almost all persons of rank in its vicinity,
eagerly sought the assistance of the new professor
for polishing the education of their females:
and all alike coveted his society for their own information
or entertainment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<p>First amongst those with whom these latter advantages
might be reciprocated, stood, as usual, in
towns far off from the metropolis, the physicians;
who, for general education, learning, science, and
politeness, are as frequently the leaders in literature
as they are the oracles in health; and who, with
the confraternity of the vicar, and the superior
lawyer, are commonly the allowed despots of erudition
and the belles lettres in provincial circles.</p>

<p>But while amongst the male inhabitants of the
town, Mr. Burney associated with many whose
understandings, and some few whose tastes, met his
own; his wife, amongst the females, was less happy,
though not more fastidious. She found them occupied
almost exclusively, in seeking who should be
earliest in importing from London what was newest
and most fashionable in attire; or in vying with
each other in giving and receiving splendid repasts;
and in struggling to make their every rotation become
more and more luxurious.</p>

<p>By no means was this love of frippery, or feebleness
of character among the females, peculiar to Lynn: such,
<span class="smcap">ALMOST</span><a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
universally, is the inheritance bequeathed

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 96]</span>

from mother to daughter in small towns at a distance from the
metropolis; where there are few suspensive subjects or pursuits of
interest, ambition, or literature, that can enlist either imagination
or instruction into conversation.</p>

<p>That men, when equally removed from the busy
turmoils of cities, or the meditative studies of retirement,
to such circumscribed spheres, should manifest
more vigour of mind, may not always be owing to
possessing it; but rather to their escaping, through
the calls of business, that inertness which casts the
females upon themselves: for though many are the
calls more refined than those of business, there are
few that more completely do away with insignificancy.</p>

<p>In the state, however, in which Lynn then was
found, Lynn will be found no longer. The tide of
ignorance is turned; and not there alone, nor alone
in any other small town, but in every village, every
hamlet, nay, every cottage in the kingdom; and
though mental cultivation is as slowly gradual, and
as precarious of circulation, as Genius, o’erleaping
all barriers, and disdaining all auxiliaries, is rapid
and decisive, still the work of general improvement
is advancing so universally, that the dark ages which
are rolling away, would soon be lost even to man’s

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 97]</span>

joy at their extirpation, but for the retrospective
and noble services of the press, through which
their memory&mdash;if only to be blasted&mdash;must live for
ever.</p>

<p>There were two exceptions, nevertheless, to this
stagnation of female merit, that were flowing with
pellucid clearness.</p>

<p>The first, Mrs. Stephen Allen, has already been
mentioned. She was the wife of a wine-merchant of
considerable fortune, and of a very worthy character.
She was the most celebrated beauty of Lynn, and
might have been so of a much larger district, for her
beauty was high, commanding, and truly uncommon:
and her understanding bore the same description.
She had wit at will; spirits the most vivacious and
entertaining; and, from a passionate fondness for
reading, she had collected stores of knowledge
which she was always able, and “nothing loath” to
display; and which raised her to as marked a pre-eminence
over her townswomen in literary acquirements,
as she was raised to exterior superiority from
her personal charms.</p>

<p>The other exception, Miss Dorothy Young, was
of a different description. She was not only denied
beauty either of face or person, but in the first she

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 98]</span>

had various unhappy defects, and in the second she
was extremely deformed.</p>

<p>Here, however, ends all that can be said in her
disfavour; for her mind was the seat of every virtue
that occasion could call into use; and her disposition
had a patience that no provocation could even momentarily
subdue; though her feelings were so sensitive,
that tears started into her eyes at every thing
she either saw or heard of mortal sufferings, or of
mortal unkindness&mdash;to any human creature but
herself.</p>

<p>It may easily be imagined that this amiable
Dorothy Young, and the elegant and intellectual
Mrs. Allen, were peculiar and deeply attached
friends.</p>

<p>When a professional call brought Mr. Burney
and his wife to this town, that accomplished couple
gave a new zest to rational, as well as a new spring
to musical, society. Mr. Burney, between business
and conviviality, immediately visited almost every
house in the county; but his wife, less easily known,
because necessarily more domestic, began her Lynn
career almost exclusively with Mrs. Allen and Dolly
Young, and proved to both an inestimable treasure;
Mrs. Allen generously avowing that she set up Mrs.

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 99]</span>

Burney as a model for her own mental improvement;
and Dolly Young becoming instinctively the most
affectionate, as well as most cultivated of Mrs. Burney’s
friends; and with an attachment so fervent
and so sincere, that she took charge of the little
family upon every occasion of its increase during the
nine or ten years of the Lynn residence.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>With regard to the extensive neighbourhood, Mr.
Burney had soon nothing left to desire in hospitality,
friendship, or politeness; and here, as heretofore,
he scarcely ever entered a house upon terms of
business, without leaving it upon those of intimacy.</p>

<p>The first mansions to which, naturally, his curiosity
pointed, and at which his ambition aimed, were
those two magnificent structures which stood loftily
pre-eminent over all others in the county of Norfolk,
Holcomb and Haughton; though neither the
nobleness of their architecture, the grandeur of
their dimensions, nor the vast expense of their
erection, bore any sway in their celebrity, that could
compare with what, at that period, they owed to the
arts of sculpture and of painting.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">HOLCOMB.</h3>

<p>At Holcomb, the superb collection of statues, as
well as of pictures, could not fail to soon draw
thither persons of such strong native taste for all the
arts as Mr. Burney and his wife; though, as there
were, at that time, which preceded the possession of
that fine mansion by the Cokes, neither pupils nor a
Male chief, no intercourse beyond that of the civilities
of reception on a public day, took place with
Mr. Burney and the last very ancient lady of the
house of Leicester, to whom Holcomb then belonged.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">HAUGHTON HALL.</h3>

<p>boasted, at that period, a collection of pictures that
not only every lover of painting, but every British
patriot in the arts, must lament that it can boast
no longer.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>It had, however, in the heir and grandson of its

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 101]</span>

founder, Sir Robert Walpole, first Earl of Orford,
a possessor of the most liberal cast; a patron of
arts and artists; munificent in promoting the prosperity
of the first, and blending pleasure with
recompense to the second, by the frank equality
with which he treated all his guests; and the ease
and freedom with which his unaffected good-humour
and good sense cheered, to all about him, his festal
board.</p>

<p>Far, nevertheless, from meriting unqualified
praise was this noble peer; and his moral defects,
both in practice and example, were as dangerous to
the neighbourhood, of which he ought to have
been the guide and protector, as the political corruption
of his famous progenitor, the statesman, had
been hurtful to probity and virtue, in the courtly
circles of his day, by proclaiming, and striving to
bring to proof, his nefarious maxim, “that every
man has his price.”</p>

<p>At the head of Lord Orford’s table was placed,
for the reception of his visitors, a person whom he
denominated simply “Patty;” and that so unceremoniously,
that all the most intimate of his associates
addressed her by the same free appellation.</p>

<p>Those, however, if such there were, who might

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 102]</span>

conclude from this degrading familiarity, that the
Patty of Lord Orford was “every body’s Patty,”
must soon have been undeceived, if tempted to make
any experiment upon such a belief. The peer knew
whom he trusted, though he rewarded not the fidelity
in which he confided; but the fond, faulty
Patty loved him with a blindness of passion, that
hid alike from her weak perceptions, her own frailties,
and his seductions.</p>

<p>In all, save that blot, which, on earth, must to a
female be ever indelible, Patty was good, faithful,
kind, friendly, and praise-worthy.</p>

<p>The table of Lord Orford, then commonly called
Arthur’s Round Table, assembled in its circle all of
peculiar merit that its neighbourhood, or rather that
the county produced, to meet there the great, the
renowned, and the splendid, who, from their various
villas, or the metropolis, visited Haughton Hall.</p>

<p>Mr. Burney was soon one of those whom the
penetrating peer selected for a general invitation to
his repasts; and who here, as at Wilbury House,
formed sundry intimacies, some of which were
enjoyed by him nearly through life. Particularly
must be mentioned</p>

<p>Mr. Hayes, who was a scholar, a man of sense,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 103]</span>

and a passionate lover of books and of prints. He
had a great and pleasant turn for humour, and a
fondness and facility for rhyming so insatiable and
irrepressible, that it seemed, like Strife in Spencer’s
Faerie Queene, to be always seeking occasion.</p>

<p>Yet, save in speaking of that propensity, Strife
and John Hayes ought never to come within the
same sentence; for in character, disposition, and
conduct, he was a compound of benevolence and
liberality.</p>

<p>There was a frankness of so unusual a cast, and a
warmth of affection, that seemed so glowing from
the heart, in Mr. Hayes for Lord Orford; joined to
so strong a resemblance in face and feature, that a
belief, if not something beyond, prevailed, that Mr.
Hayes was a natural son of Sir Robert Walpole, the
first Earl of Orford, and, consequently, a natural
uncle of his Lordship’s grandson.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">RAINHAM.</h3>

<p>To name the several mansions that called for,
or welcomed, Mr. Burney, would almost be to make
a Norfolk Register. At Rainham Castle he was
full as well received by its master, General Lord

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 104]</span>

Townshend, as a guest, as by its lady, the Baroness
de Frerrars in her own right, for an instructor; the
lady being natively cold and quiet, though well bred
and sensible; while the General was warm-hearted,
witty, and agreeable; and conceived a liking for
Mr. Burney, that was sustained, with only added
regard, through all his lordship’s various elevations.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">FELBRIG.</h3>

<p>But there was no villa to which he resorted with
more certainty of finding congenial pleasure, than to
Felbrig, where he began an acquaintance of highest
esteem and respect with Mr. Windham, father of
the Right Honourable Privy Counsellor and orator;
with whom, also, long afterwards, he became still
more closely connected; and who proved himself
just the son that so erudite and elegant a parent
would have joyed to have reared, had he lived to
behold the distinguished rank in the political and in
the learned world to which that son rose; and the
admiration which he excited, and the pleasure which
he expanded in select society.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">WILLIAM BEWLEY.</h3>

<p>A name next comes forward that must not briefly
be glided by; that of William Bewley; a man for
whom Mr. Burney felt the most enlightened friendship
that the sympathetic magnetism of similar
tastes, humours, and feelings, could inspire.</p>

<p>Mr. Bewley was truly a philosopher, according
to the simplest, though highest, acceptation of that
word; for his love of wisdom was of that unsophisticated
species, that regards learning, science,
and knowledge, with whatever delight they may
be pursued abstractedly, to be wholly subservient,
collectively, to the duties and practice of benevolence.</p>

<p>To this nobleness of soul, which made the basis
of his character, he superadded a fund of wit equally
rare, equally extraordinary: it was a wit that
sparkled from the vivid tints of an imagination as
pure as it was bright; untarnished by malice, uninfluenced
by spleen, uninstigated by satire. It
was playful, original, eccentric: but the depth with
which it could have cut, and slashed, and pierced
around him, would never have been even surmised,
from the urbanity with which he forbore making

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 106]</span>

that missile use of its power, had he not frequently
darted out its keenest edge in ridicule against himself.</p>

<p>And not alone in this personal severity did he
resemble the self-unsparing Scarron; his outside,
though not deformed, was peculiarly unfortunate;
and his eyes, though announcing, upon examination,
something of his mind, were ill-shaped, and ill set
in his head, and singularly small; and no other
feature parried this local disproportion; for his
mouth, and his under-jaw, which commonly hung
open, were displeasing to behold.</p>

<p>The first sight, however, which of so many is
the best, was of Mr. Bewley, not only the worst,
but the only bad; for no sooner, in the most
squeamish, was the revolted eye turned away, than
the attracted ear, even of the most fastidious,
brought it back, to listen to genuine instruction
conveyed through unexpected pleasantry.</p>

<p>This original and high character, was that of an
obscure surgeon of Massingham, a small town in
the neighbourhood of Haughton Hall. He had
been brought up with no advantages, but what
laborious toil had worked out of native abilities;
and he only subsisted by the ordinary process of

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 107]</span>

rigidly following up the multifarious calls to which,
in its provincial practice, his widely diversified profession
is amenable.</p>

<p>Yet not wholly in “the desert air,” were his
talents doomed to be wasted: they were no sooner
spoken of at Haughton Hall, than the gates of that
superb mansion were spontaneously flung open, and
its Chief proved at once, and permanently remained,
his noble patron and kind friend.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">LYNN REGIS.</h3>

<p>The visits of Mr. Burney to Massingham, and
his attachment to its philosopher, contributed, more
than any other connection, to stimulate that love
and pursuit of knowledge, that urge its votaries to
snatch from waste or dissipation those fragments
of time, which, by the general herd of mankind,
are made over to Lethe, for reading; learning
languages; composing music; studying sciences;
fathoming the theoretical and mathematical depths
of his own art; and seeking at large every species
of intelligence to which either chance or design
afforded him any clew.</p>

<p>As he could wait upon his country pupils only

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 108]</span>

on horseback, he purchased a mare that so exactly
suited his convenience and his wishes, in sure-footedness,
gentleness and sagacity, that she soon
seemed to him a part of his family: and the welfare
and comfort of Peggy became, ere long, a
matter of kind interest to all his house.</p>

<p>On this mare he studied Italian; for, obliged to
go leisurely over the cross roads with which Norfolk
then abounded, and which were tiresome from
dragging sands, or dangerous from deep ruts in
clay, half his valuable time would have been lost
in nothingness, but for his trust in Peggy; who
was as careful in safely picking her way, as she
was adroit in remembering from week to week
whither she was meant to go.</p>

<p>Her master, at various odd moments, and from
various opportunities, had compressed, from the best
Italian Dictionaries, every word of the Italian language
into a small octavo volume; and from this
in one pocket, and a volume of Dante, Petrarch,
Tasso, Ariosto, or Metastasio, in another, he made
himself completely at home in that language of
elegance and poetry.</p>

<p>His common-place book, at this period, rather
merits the appellation of <em>un</em>common, from the assiduous

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 109]</span>

research it manifests, to illustrate every sort
of information, by extracts, abstracts, strictures, or
descriptions, upon the almost universality of subject-matter
which it contains.</p>

<p>It is without system or method; he had no leisure
to put it into order; yet it is possible, he
might owe to his familiar recurrence to that desultory
assemblage of unconcocted materials, the general
and striking readiness with which he met at once
almost every topic of discourse.</p>

<p>This manuscript of scraps, drawn from reading
and observation, was, like his Italian Dictionary,
always in his great-coat pocket, when he travelled;
so that if unusually rugged roads, or busied haste,
impeded more regular study, he was sure, in opening
promiscuously his pocket collection of <em>odds and
ends</em>, to come upon some remark worth weighing;
some point of science on which to ruminate; some
point of knowledge to fix in his memory; or something
amusing, grotesque, or little known, that
might recreate his fancy.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">THE GREVILLES.</h3>

<p>Meanwhile, he had made too real an impression
on the affections of his first friends, to let absence of

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 110]</span>

sight produce absence of mind. With Mr. and Mrs.
Greville he was always in correspondence; though,
of course, neither frequently nor punctually, now
that his engagements were so numerous, his obligations
to fulfil them so serious, and that his own fireside
was so bewitchingly in harmony with his feelings,
as to make every moment he passed away
from it a sacrifice.</p>

<p>He expounds his new situation and new devoirs,
in reply to a letter that had long been unanswered,
of Mr. Greville’s, from the Continent, with a sincerity
so ingenuous that, though it is in rhyme, it is
here inserted biographically.</p>

<p>The epistle then goes on to strictures frank and
honest, though softened off by courteous praise and
becoming diffidence, on a manuscript poem of Mr.
Greville’s, that had been confidentially transmitted
to Lynn, for the private opinion and critical judgment
of Mr. Burney.</p>

<p>Mr. Greville, now, was assuming a new character&mdash;that
of an author; and he printed a work which he
had long had in agitation, entitled “Maxims,
Characters, and Reflections, Moral, Serious, and
Entertaining;” a title that seemed to announce
that England, in its turn, was now to produce, in
a man of family and fashion, a La Bruyere, or a
La Rochefoucaul. And Mr. Greville, in fact,
waited for a similar fame with dignity rather than
anxiety, because with expectation unclogged by
doubt.</p>

<p>With Mrs. Greville, also, Mr. Burney kept up
an equal, or more than equal, intercourse, for their
minds were invariably in unison.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 113]</span></p>

<p>The following copy remains of a burlesque rhyming

Mrs. Greville in that of Miss Biddy Bellair, upon

<p>Mrs. Greville, too, had commenced being an
author; but without either the throes of pain or the
joys of hope. It was, in fact, a burst of genius
emanating from a burst of sorrow, which found an
alleviating vent in a supplication to Indifference.</p>

<p>This celebrated ode was no sooner seen than it
was hailed with a blaze of admiration, that passed
first from friend to friend; next from newspapers
to magazines; and next to every collection of fugitive
pieces of poetry in the English language.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 115]</span></p>

<p>The constant friendship that subsisted between
this lady and Mr. Burney bad been cemented after
his marriage, by the grateful pleasure with which he
saw his chosen partner almost instantly included in
it by a triple bond. The quick-sighted, and quick-feeling
author of that sensitive ode, needed nor time
nor circumstance for animating her perception of
such merit as deserved a place in her heart; which
had not, at that early period, become a suppliant
for the stoical composure with which her wounded
sensibility sought afterwards to close its passage.</p>

<p>She had first seen the fair Esther in the dawning
bloom of youthful wedded love, while new-born
happiness enlivened her courage, embellished her
beauty, and enabled her to do honour to the choice
of her happy husband; who stood so high in the
favour of Mrs. Greville, that the sole aim of that
lady, in the opening of the acquaintance, had been
his gratification; aided, perhaps, by a natural curiosity,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 116]</span>

which attaches itself to the sight of any object
who has inspired an extraordinary passion.</p>

<p>Far easier to conceive than to delineate was the
rapture of the young bridegroom when, upon a
meeting that, unavoidably, must have been somewhat
tremendous, he saw the exertions of his lovely bride
to substitute serenity for bashfulness; and read, in
the piercing eyes of Mrs. Greville, the fullest approbation
of such native self-possession.</p>

<p>From that time all inferiority of worldly situation
was counteracted by intellectual equality.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>But the intercourse had for several years been
interrupted from the Grevilles living abroad. It
was renewed, however, upon their return to England;
and the Burneys, with their eldest daughter,<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
visited Wilbury House upon every vacation that
allowed time to Mr. Burney for the excursion. And
every fresh meeting increased the zest for another.
They fell into the same train of observation upon
characters, things, and books; and enjoyed, with
the same gaiety of remark, all humorous incidents,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 117]</span>

and all traits of characteristic eccentricity. Mrs.
Greville began a correspondence with Mrs. Burney
the most open and pleasantly communicative. But
no letters of Mrs. Burney remain; and two only of
Mrs. Greville have been preserved. These two,
however, demonstrate all that has been said of the
terms and the trust of their sociality.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">DOCTOR JOHNSON.</h3>

<p>How singularly Mr. Burney merited encouragement
himself, cannot more aptly be exemplified than
by portraying the genuine ardour with which he
sought to stimulate the exertions of genius in others,
and to promote their golden as well as literary
laurels.</p>

<p>Mr. Burney was one of the first and most fervent
admirers of those luminous periodical essays upon
morals, literature, and human nature, that adorned
the eighteenth century, and immortalized their
author, under the vague and inadequate titles of the
Rambler and the Idler. He took them both in; he
read them to all his friends; and was the first to
bring them to a bookish little coterie that assembled

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 118]</span>

weekly at Mrs. Stephen Allen’s. And the charm
expanded over these meetings, by the original lecture
of these refined and energetic lessons of life,
conduct, and opinions, when breathed through the
sympathetic lips of one who felt every word with
nearly the same force with which every word had
been dictated, excited in that small auditory a species
of enthusiasm for the author, that exalted him at
once in their ideas, to that place which the general
voice of his country has since assigned him, of the
first writer of the age.</p>

<p>Mr. Bewley more than joined in this literary idolatry;
and the works, the character, and the name of
Dr. Johnson, were held by him in a reverence nearly
enthusiastic.</p>

<p>At Haughton, at Felbrig, at Rainham, at Sir A.
Wodehouse’s, at Major Mackenzie’s, and wherever
his judgment had weight, Mr. Burney introduced
and recommended these papers. And when, in 1755,
the plan of Dr. Johnson’s Dictionary reached Norfolk,
Mr. Burney, by the zeal with which he spread
the fame of that lasting monument of the Doctor’s
matchless abilities, was enabled to collect orders for
a Norfolk packet of half a dozen copies of that noble
work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 119]</span></p>

<p>This empowered him to give some vent to his
admiration; and the following letter made the
opening to a connection that he always considered
as one of the greatest honours of his life.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center smcap">Mr. Burney to Mr. Johnson.</p>

<p class="sig-left5">“Sir,</p>

<p>“Though I have never had the happiness of a personal knowledge
of you, I cannot think myself wholly a stranger to a man
with whose sentiments I have so long been acquainted; for it
seems to me as if the writer, who was sincere, had effected the
plan of that philosopher who wished men had windows at their
breasts, through which the affections of their hearts might be
viewed.</p>

<p>“It is with great self-denial that I refrain from giving way to
panegyric in speaking of the pleasure and instruction I have received
from your admirable writings; but knowing that transcendent
merit shrinks more at praise, than either vice or dulness at

<span class="pagenum-block">[Pg 120]</span>

censure, I shall compress my encomiums into a short compass,
and only tell you that I revere your principles and integrity, in
not prostituting your genius, learning, and knowledge of the
human heart, in ornamenting vice or folly with those beautiful
flowers of language due only to wisdom and virtue. I must
add, that your periodical productions seem to me models of true
genius, useful learning, and elegant diction, employed in the
service of the purest precepts of religion, and the most inviting
morality.</p>

<p>“I shall waive any further gratification of my wish to tell you,
Sir, how much I have been delighted by your productions, and
proceed to the <em>business</em> of this letter; which is no other than to
beg the favour of you to inform me, by the way that will give
you the least trouble, when, and in what manner, your admirably
planned, and long wished-for Dictionary will be published? If it
should be by subscription, or you should have any books at your
own disposal, I shall beg of you to favour me with six copies for
myself and friends, for which I will send you a draft.</p>

<p>“I ought to beg pardon of the public as well as yourself, Sir,
for detaining you thus long from your useful labours; but it is
the fate of men of eminence to be persecuted by insignificant
friends as well as enemies; and the simple cur who barks
through fondness and affection, is no less troublesome than if
stimulated by anger and aversion.</p>

<p>“I hope, however, that your philosophy will incline you to
forgive the intemperance of my zeal and impatience in making
these inquiries; as well as my ambition to subscribe myself,
with very great regard,</p>

<div class="topspace2"></div>

<p>Within two months of the date of this letter, its
writer was honoured with the following answer.</p>

<div class="topspace2"></div>

<blockquote>
<p class="center">“<i>To Mr. Burney, in Lynn Regis, Norfolk.</i><br />
</p>
<p class="sig-left5">“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>“If you imagine that by delaying my answer I intended to
shew any neglect of the notice with which you have favoured
me, you will neither think justly of yourself nor of me. Your
civilities were offered with too much elegance not to engage
attention; and I have too much pleasure in pleasing men like
you, not to feel very sensibly the distinction which you have
bestowed upon me.</p>

<p>“Few consequences of my endeavours to please or to benefit
mankind, have delighted me more than your friendship thus
voluntarily offered; which, now I have it, I hope to keep,
because I hope to continue to deserve it.</p>

<p>“I have no Dictionaries to dispose of for myself; but shall
be glad to have you direct your friends to Mr. Dodsley, because
it was by his recommendation that I was employed in
the work.</p>

<p>“When you have leisure to think again upon me, let me be
favoured with another letter, and another yet, when you have
looked into my Dictionary. If you find faults, I shall endeavour
to mend them: if you find none, I shall think you blinded
by kind partiality: but to have made you partial in his favour
will very much gratify the ambition of,</p>

<div class="topspace2"></div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 122]</span></p>

<p>A reply so singularly encouraging, demanding
“another letter,” and yet “another,” raised the
spirits, and flattered the hopes&mdash;it might almost
be said the foresight&mdash;of Mr. Burney, with a prospect
of future intimacy, that instigated the following
unaffected answer.<br /></p>

<div class="topspace2"></div>

<blockquote>
<p class="smcap sig-left5">“Sir,<br />
</p>

<p>“That you should think my letter worthy of notice was what
I began to despair of; and, indeed, I had framed and admitted
several reasons for your silence, more than sufficient for your
exculpation. But so highly has your politeness overrated my
intentions, that I find it impossible for me to resist accepting
the invitation with which you have honoured me, of writing
to you again, though conscious that I have nothing to offer
that can by any means merit your attention.</p>

<p>“It is with the utmost impatience that I await the possession
of your great work, in which every literary difficulty will he
solved, and curiosity gratified, at least as far as English literature
is concerned: nor am I fearful of letting expectation rise
to the highest summit in which she can accompany reason.</p>

<p>“From what you are pleased to say concerning Mr. Dodsley, I
shall ever think myself much his debtor; but yet I cannot help
suspecting that you intended him a compliment when you
talked of <em>recommendation</em>. Is it possible that the world should
be so blind, or booksellers so stupid, as to need other recommendation
than your own? Indeed, I shall honour <em>both</em>, world
and booksellers, so far as to substitute <em>solicitation</em> in the place
of the above humiliating term.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Perhaps you will smile when I inform you, that since first
the rumour of your Dictionary’s coming abroad this winter
was spread, I have been supposed to be marvellously deep in
politics: not a sun has set since the above time without previously
lighting me to the coffee-house; nor risen, without
renewing my curiosity. But time, the great revealer of secrets,
has at length put an end to my solicitude; for, if there be truth
in book men, I can now, by cunning calculation, foretell the
day and hour when it will arrive at Lynn.</p>

<p>“If, which is probable, I should fix my future abode in London,
I cannot help rejoicing that I shall then be an inhabitant
of the same town, and exulting that I shall then be a fellow
citizen with Mr. Johnson; and were it possible I could be
honoured with a small share of his esteem, I should regard it
as the most grateful circumstance of my life. And&mdash;shall I
add, that I have a female companion, whose intellects are sufficiently
masculine to enter into the true spirit of your writings,
and, consequently, to have an enthusiastic zeal for them and
their author? How happy would your presence make us over
our tea, so often meliorated by your productions!</p>

<p>“If, in the mean time, your avocations would permit you
to bestow a line or two upon me, without greatly incommoding
yourself, it would communicate the highest delight to</p>

<p>“Have you, Sir, ever met with a little French book, entitled,
‘Synonimes Fran&ccedil;ois, par M. l’Abb&eacute; Girard?’ I am inclined
to imagine, if you have not seen it, that it would afford you, as

<span class="pagenum-block">[Pg 124]</span>

a philologer, some pleasure, it being written with great spirit,
and, I think, accuracy: but I should rejoice to have my opinion
either confirmed or corrected by yours. If you should find any
difficulty in procuring the book, mine is wholly at your service.”</p>

<div class="topspace2"></div>

<p>To this letter there was little chance of any
answer, the demanded “another,” relative to the
Dictionary, being still due.</p>

<p>That splendid, and probably, from any single
intellect, unequalled work, for vigour of imagination
and knowledge amidst the depths of erudition,
came out in 1756. And, early in 1757, Mr.
Burney paid his faithful homage to its author.</p>

<p>“Without exercising the greatest self-denial, I should not have
been able thus long to withhold from you my grateful acknowledgments
for the delight and instruction you have afforded
me by means of your admirable Dictionary&mdash;a work, I believe,
not yet equalled in any language; for, not to mention the
accuracy, precision, and elegance of the definitions, the illustrations
of words are so judiciously and happily selected as to
render it a repository, and, I had almost said, universal register
of whatever is sublime or beautiful in English literature.
In looking for words, we constantly find things. The road,

<span class="pagenum-block">[Pg 125]</span>

indeed, to the former, is so flowery as not to be travelled with
speed, at least by me, who find it impossible to arrive at the
intelligence I want, without bating by the way, and revelling
in collateral entertainment. Were I to express all that I think
upon this subject, your Dictionary would be stript of a great
part of its furniture: but as praise is never gratefully received
by the justly deserving till a deduction is first made of the ignorance
or partiality of him who bestows it, I shall support my
opinion by a passage from a work of reputation among our
neighbours, which, if it have not yet reached you, I shall rejoice
at being the first to communicate, in hopes of augmenting the
satisfaction arising from honest fame, and a conviction of having
conferred benefits on mankind: well knowing with how parsimonious
and niggard a hand men administer comfort of the kind
to modest merit.</p>

<p>It was yet some years later than this last date
of correspondence, before Mr. Burney found an
opportunity of paying his personal respects to Dr.
Johnson; who then, in 1760, resided in chambers

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 127]</span>

at the Temple. No account, unfortunately, remains
of this first interview, except an anecdote that
relates to Mr. Bewley.</p>

<p>While awaiting the appearance of his revered
host, Mr. Burney recollected a supplication from
the philosopher of Massingham, to be indulged with
some token, however trifling or common, of his
friend’s admission to the habitation of this great
man. Vainly, however, Mr. Burney looked around
the apartment for something that he might innoxiously
purloin. Nothing but coarse and necessary
furniture was in view; nothing portable&mdash;not
even a wafer, the cover of a letter, or a split pen,
was to be caught; till, at length, he had the happiness
to espie an old hearth broom in the chimney
corner. From this, with hasty glee, he cut off a
bristly wisp, which he hurried into his pocket-book;
and afterwards formally folded in silver paper, and
forwarded, in a frank, to Lord Orford, for Mr.
Bewley; by whom the burlesque offering was hailed
with good-humoured acclamation, and preserved
through life.</p>

<p>In this manner passed on, quick though occupied,
and happy though toilsome, nine or ten years

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 128]</span>

in Norfolk; when the health of Mr. Burney being
re-established, and his rising reputation demanding
a wider field for expansion, a sort of cry was raised
amongst his early friends to spur his return to the
metropolis.</p>

<p>Fully, however, as he felt the flattery of that cry,
and ill as, in its origin, he had been satisfied with
his Lynn residence, he had now experienced from
that town and its vicinity, so much true kindness,
and cordial hospitality, that his reluctance to quit
them was verging upon renouncing such a measure;
when he received the following admonition upon
the subject from his first friend, and earliest guide,

</blockquote>

<div class="topspace2"></div>

<p>Mr. Crisp, almost immediately after this letter,
visited, and for some years, the continent.</p>

<p>This exhortation, in common with whatever
emanated from Mr. Crisp, proved decisive; and
Mr. Burney fixed at once his resolve upon returning
to the capital; though some years still
passed ere he could put it in execution.</p>

<p>The following are his reflections, written at a
much later period, upon this determination.</p>

<p>After enumerating, with warm regard, the many
to whom he owed kindness in the county of Norfolk,
he adds:</p>

<div class="topspace2"></div>

<blockquote>
<p>“All of these, for nearly thirty miles round, had their houses
and tables pressingly open to me: and, in the town of Lynn,
my wife, to all evening parties, though herself no card player,
never failed to be equally invited; for she had a most delightful
turn in conversation, seasoned with agreeable wit, and pleasing

<span class="pagenum-block">[Pg 130]</span>

manners; and great powers of entering into the humours of her
company; which, with the beauty of her person, occasioned her
to receive more invitations than she wished; as she was truly
domestic, had a young family on her hands, and, generally, one
of them at her breast. But whenever we could spend an evening
at home, without disappointing our almost too kind inviters,
we had a course of reading so various and entertaining, in
history, voyages, poetry, and, as far as Chambers’ Dictionary, the
Philosophical Transactions, and the French Encyclopedia, to the
first edition of which I was a subscriber, could carry us, in
science, that those <i lang="fr">t&ecirc;te &agrave; t&ecirc;te</i> seclusions were what we enjoyed
the most completely.</p>

<p>“This, of course, raised my wife far above all the females of
Lynn, who were, then, no readers, with the exception of Mrs.
Stephen Allen and Dolly Young. And this congeniality of
taste brought on an intimacy of friendship in these three females,
that lasted during their several lives.</p>

<p>“My wife was the delight of all her acquaintance; excellent
mother&mdash;zealous friend&mdash;of highly superior intellects.</p>

<p>“We enjoyed at Lynn tranquillity and social happiness&mdash;”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

</blockquote>

<div class="topspace2"></div>

<p>Here again must be inserted another poetical
epistle, written, during a short separation, while still
at Lynn; which shews that, with whatever fervour
of passion he married, he himself was “that other
happy man,” in the words of Lord Lyttleton, who
had found “How much the wife is dearer than the
bride.”</p>

<p>The last act of Mr. Burney in relinquishing his
residence in Norfolk, was drawing up a petition
to Lord Orford to allow park-room in the Haughton
grounds, for the rest of its life, to his excellent,
faithful mare, the intelligent Peggy; whose truly
useful services he could not bear to requite, according
to the unfeeling usage of the many, by
selling her to hard labour in the decline of her
existence.</p>

<p>Lord Orford good-humouredly complied with the
request; and the justly-prized Peggy, after enjoying
for several years the most perfect ease and freedom,
died the death of old age, in Haughton Park.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">LONDON.</h3>

<p>In 1760 Mr. Burney, with his wife and young
family, returned to London; but no longer to the
city, which has the peculiar fate, whilst praised and
reverenced by the many who to its noble encouragement
owe their first dawn of prosperity, of

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 134]</span>

being almost always set aside and relinquished,
when that prosperity is effected. Is it that Fortune,
like the sun, while it rises, cold, though of
fairest promise, in the East, must ever, in its more
luxuriant splendour, set in the West?</p>

<p>The new establishment was in Poland-street;
which was not then, as it is now, a sort of street
that, like the rest of its neighbourhood, appears to
be left in the lurch. House-fanciers were not yet
as fastidious as they are become at present, from
the endless variety of new habitations. Oxford-road,
as, at that time, Oxford-street was called,
into which Poland-street terminated, had little on
its further side but fields, gardeners’ grounds, or
uncultivated suburbs. Portman, Manchester, Russel,
Belgrave squares, Portland-place, &amp;c. &amp;c., had
not yet a single stone or brick laid, in signal of
intended erection: while in plain Poland-street, Mr.
Burney, then, had successively for his neighbours,
the Duke of Chandos, Lady Augusta Bridges, the
Hon. John Smith and the Miss Barrys, Sir Willoughby
and the Miss Astons; and, well noted by
Mr. Burney’s little family, on the visit of his black
majesty to England, sojourned, almost immediately
opposite to it, the Cherokee King.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>The opening of this new plan of life, was as
successful to Mr. Burney as its projection had been
promising. Pupils of rank, wealth, and talents,
were continually proposed to him; and, in a very
short time, he had hardly an hour unappropriated
to some fair disciple.</p>

<p>Lady Tankerville, amongst the rest, resumed her
lessons with her early master, obligingly submitting
her time to his convenience, be it what it might,
rather than change her first favourite instructor.
Ere long, however, she resided almost wholly abroad,
having attached herself with enthusiastic fervour to
the Princess Amelia, sister to Frederick the Great
of Prussia. The Countess even accepted the place
of Dame d’Atour to that accomplished princess;
whose charms, according to poetical record, banished
for a while their too daring admirer, Voltaire, from
the Court of Berlin.</p>

<p>This enterprising Countess retained her spirit of
whim, singularity, and activity, through a long life;
for when, many years later, she returned to her
own country, quite old, while Dr. Burney had not
yet reached the zenith of his fame, she again applied
to him for musical tuition; and when he told her,
with regret, that his day was completely filled up,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 136]</span>

from eight o’clock in the morning; “Come to
me, then,” cried she, with vivacity, “at seven!”
which appointment literally, and twice a week, took
place.</p>

<p>All the first friends of Mr. Burney were happy
to renew with him their social intercourse. Mrs.
Greville, when in town, was foremost in eagerly
seeking his Esther; and Mr. Greville met again
his early favourite with all his original impetuosity
of regard: while their joint newer friends of Norfolk,
Mrs. Stephen Allen and Miss Dorothy Young
in particular, warmly sustained an unremitting communication
by letters: and Lords Orford, Eglinton,
and March, General Lord Townshend, Charles
Boone, and many others, sought this enlivening
couple, with an unabating sense of their worth,
upon every occasion that either music or conversation
offered, for accepting, or desiring, admission
to their small parties: for so uncommon were the
powers of pleasing which they possessed, that all
idea of condescension in their worldly superiors
seemed superseded, if not annihilated, by personal
eagerness to enjoy their rare society.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 137]</span></p>
<h3 class="nobreak">ESTHER.</h3>

<p>Thus glided away, in peace, domestic joys, improvement,
and prosperity, this first&mdash;and last!
happy year of the new London residence. In the
course of the second, a cough, with alarming symptoms,
menaced the breast of the life and soul of the
little circle; consisting now of six children, clinging
with equal affection around each parent chief.</p>

<p>She rapidly grew weaker and worse. Her tender
husband hastened her to Bristol Hotwells, whither
he followed her upon his first possible vacation; and
where, in a short time, he had the extasy to believe
that he saw her recover, and to bring her back to
her fond little family.</p>

<p>But though hope was brightened, expectation
was deceived! stability of strength was restored
no more; and, in the ensuing autumn, she was
seized with an inflammatory disorder with which
her delicate and shaken frame had not force to
combat. No means were left unessayed to stop the
progress of danger; but all were fruitless! and,
after less than a week of pain the most terrific,
the deadly ease of mortification suddenly, awfully
succeeded to the most excruciating torture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 138]</span></p>

<p>Twelve stated hours of morbid bodily repose
became, from that tremendous moment of baleful
relief, the counted boundary of her earthly existence.</p>

<p>The wretchedness of her idolizing husband at
the development of such a predestined termination to
her sufferings, when pronounced by the celebrated
Dr. Hunter, was only not distraction. But she
herself, though completely aware that her hours
now were told, met the irrevocable doom with
open, religious, and even cheerful composure&mdash;sustained,
no doubt, by the blessed aspirations of
mediatory salvation; and calmly declaring that she
quitted the world with perfect tranquillity, save
for leaving her tender husband and helpless children.
And, in the arms of that nearly frantic
husband, who, till that fatal epoch, had literally
believed her existence and his own, in this mortal
journey, to be indispensably one&mdash;she expired.</p>

<p>When the fatal scene was finally closed, the disconsolate
survivor immured himself almost from
light and life, through inability to speak or act, or
yet to bear witnesses to his misery.</p>

<p>He was soon, however, direfully called from this
concentrated anguish, by the last awful summons

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 139]</span>

to the last awful rites to human memory, the
funeral; which he attended in a frame of mind
that nothing, probably, could have rescued from
unrestrained despair, save a pious invocation to
submission that had been ejaculated by his Esther,
when she perceived his rising agony, in an impressive
“Oh, Charles!”&mdash;almost at the very
moment she was expiring: an appeal that could
not but still vibrate in his penetrated ears, and
control his tragic passions.</p>

<p>The character, and its rare, resplendent worth,
of this inestimable person, is best committed to the
pen of him to whom it best was known; as will
appear by the subsequent letter, copied from his
own hand-writing. It was found amongst his
posthumous papers, so ill-written and so blotted
by his tears, that he must have felt himself obliged
to re-write it for the post.</p>

<p>It may be proper to again mention, that though
Esther was maternally of French extraction, and
though her revered mother was a Roman Catholic,
she herself was a confirmed Protestant. But that
angelic mother had brought her up with a love
and a practice of genuine piety which undeviatingly
intermingled in every action, and, probably, in

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 140]</span>

every thought of her virtuous life, so religiously,
so deeply, that neither pain nor calamity could
make her impatient of existence; nor yet could
felicity the most perfect make her reluctant to die.</p>

<p>To paint the despairing grief produced by this
deadly blow must be cast, like the portrait of its
object, upon the sufferer; and the inartificial pathos,
the ingenuous humility, with which both are
marked in the affecting detail of her death, written
in answer to a letter of sympathizing condolence
from the tenderest friend of the deceased, Miss
Dorothy Young, so strongly speak a language of
virtue as well as of sorrow, that, unconsciously,
they exhibit his own fair unsophisticated character
in delineating that of his lost love. A more touching
description of happiness in conjugal life, or of
wretchedness in its dissolution, is rarely, perhaps, with
equal simplicity of truth, to be found upon record.</p>

<div class="topspace2"></div>

<blockquote>
<p class="center smcap">“To Miss Dorothy Young.</p>

<p>“I had not thought it possible that any thing could urge me to
write in the present deplorable disposition of my mind; but my
dear Miss Young’s letter haunts me! Neither did I think it possible
for any thing to add to my affliction, borne down and
broken-hearted as I am. But the current of your woes and sympathetic
sorrows meeting mine, has overpowered all bounds which

<span class="pagenum-block">[Pg 141]</span>

religion, philosophy, reason, or even despair, may have been
likely to set to my grief. Oh Miss Young! you knew her
worth&mdash;you were one of the few people capable of seeing and
feeling it. Good God! that she should be snatched from me at
a time when I thought her health re-establishing, and fixing for
a long old age! when our plans began to succeed, and we flattered
ourselves with enjoying each other’s society ere long, in a
peaceable and quiet retirement from the bustling frivolousness of
a capital, to which our niggard stars had compelled us to fly
for the prospect of establishing our children.</p>

<p>“Amongst the numberless losses I sustain, there are none that
unman me so much as the total deprivation of domestic comfort
and converse&mdash;that converse from which I tore myself with such
difficulty in a morning, and to which I flew back with such celerity
at night! She was the source of all I could ever project or
perform that was praise-worthy&mdash;all that I could do that was
laudable had an eye to her approbation. There was a rectitude
in her mind and judgment, that rendered her approbation so
animating, so rational, so satisfactory! I have lost the spur, the
stimulus to all exertions, all warrantable pursuits,&mdash;except those
of another world. From an ambitious, active, enterprising Being,
I am become a torpid drone, a listless, desponding wretch!&mdash;I
know you will bear with my weakness, nay, in part, participate
in it; but this is a kind of dotage unfit for common eyes, or even
for common friends, to be entrusted with.</p>

<p>“You kindly, and truly, my dear Miss Young, styled her one of
the greatest ornaments of society; but, apart from the ornamental,
in which she shone in a superior degree, think, oh
think, of her high merit as a daughter, mother, wife, sister,
friend! I always, from the first moment I saw her to the last,
had an ardent passion for her person, to which time had added

<span class="pagenum-block">[Pg 142]</span>

true friendship and rational regard. Perhaps it is honouring
myself too much to say, few people were more suited to each
other; but, at least, I always endeavoured to render myself more
worthy of her than nature, perhaps, had formed me. But she
could mould me to what she pleased! A distant hint&mdash;a remote
wish from her was enough to inspire me with courage for any
undertaking. But all is lost and gone in losing her&mdash;the whole
world is a desert to me! nor does its whole circumference afford
the least hope of succour&mdash;not a single ray of that fortitude She
so fully possessed!</p>

<p>“You, and all who knew her, respected and admired her understanding
while she was living. Judge, then, with what awe and
veneration I must be struck to hear her counsel when dying!&mdash;to
see her meet that tremendous spectre, death, with that calmness,
resignation, and true religious fortitude, that no stoic philosopher,
nor scarcely christian, could surpass; for it was all in
privacy and simplicity. Socrates and Seneca called their friends
around them to give them that courage that perhaps solitude
might have robbed them of, and to spread abroad their fame to
posterity; but she, dear pattern of humility! had no such vain
view; no parade, no grimace! When she was aware that all
was over&mdash;when she had herself pronounced the dread sentence,
that she felt she should not outlive the coming night, she composedly
gave herself up to religion, and begged that she might
not be interrupted in her prayers and meditations.</p>

<p>“Afterwards she called me to her, and then tranquilly talked
about our family and affairs, in a manner quite oracular.</p>

<p>“Sometime later she desired to see Hetty,<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> who, till that day,
had spent the miserable week almost constantly at her bed-side,

<span class="pagenum-block">[Pg 143]</span>

or at the foot of the bed. Fanny, Susan, and Charley, had been
sent, some days before, to the kind care of Mrs. Sheeles in Queen-Square,
to be out of the way; and little Charlotte was taken to the
house of her nurse.</p>

<p>“To poor Hetty she then discoursed in so kind, so feeling, so
tender a manner, that I am sure her words will never be forgotten.
And, this over, she talked of her own death&mdash;her
funeral&mdash;her place of burial,&mdash;with as much composure as if
talking of a journey to Lynn! Think of this, my dear Miss
Young, and see the impossibility of supporting such a loss&mdash;such
an adieu, with calmness! I hovered over her till she sighed, not
groaned, her last&mdash;placidly sighed it&mdash;just after midnight.</p>

<p>“Her disorder was an inflammation of the stomach, with which
she was seized on the 19th of September, after being on that
day, and for some days previously, remarkably in health and
spirits. She suffered the most excruciating torments for eight
days, with a patience, a resignation, nearly quite silent. Her
malady baffled all medical skill from the beginning. I called in
Dr. Hunter.</p>

<p>“On the 28th, the last day! she suffered, I suppose, less, perhaps
nothing! as mortification must have taken place, which must
have afforded that sort of ease, that those who have escaped such
previous agony shudder to think of! On that ever memorable,
that dreadful day, she talked more than she had done throughout
her whole illness. She forgot nothing, nor threw one word
away! always hoping we should meet and know each other hereafter!&mdash;She
told poor Hetty how sweet it would be if she could
see her constantly from whence she was going, and begged she
would invariably suppose that that would be the case. What a
lesson to leave to a daughter!&mdash;She exhorted her to remember
how much her example might influence the poor younger ones;

<span class="pagenum-block">[Pg 144]</span>

and bid her write little letters, and fancies, to her in the other
world, to say how they all went on; adding, that she felt as if
she should surely know something of them.</p>

<p>“Afterwards, feeling probably her end fast approaching, she
serenely said, with one hand on the head of Hetty, and the other
grasped in mine: “Now this is dying pleasantly! in the arms of
one’s friends!” I burst into an unrestrained agony of grief, when,
with a superiority of wisdom, resignation, and true religion,&mdash;though
awaiting, consciously, from instant to instant awaiting
the shaft of death,&mdash;she mildly uttered, in a faint, faint voice, but
penetratingly tender, “Oh Charles!&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I checked myself instantaneously, over-awed and stilled as
by a voice from one above. I felt she meant to beg me not to
agitate her last moments!&mdash;I entreated her forgiveness, and told
her it was but human nature. “And so it is!” said she, gently;
and presently added, “Nay, it is worse for the living than the
dying,&mdash;though a moment sets us even!&mdash;life is but a paltry
business&mdash;yet</p>

<div class="topspace2"></div>


<p>Part of a letter, also, to Mrs. Stephen Allen, the
friend to whom, next to Miss Dorothy Young, the
departed had been most attached, seems to belong
to this place. Its style, as it was written at a later
period, is more composed; but it evinces in the
wretched mourner the same devotion to his Esther’s
excellences, and the same hopelessness of earthly
happiness.</p>

<div class="topspace2"></div>

<p>“Even prosperity is insipid without participation with those we
love; for me, therefore, heaven knows, all is at an end&mdash;all is
accumulated wretchedness! I have lost a soul congenial with
my own;&mdash;a companion, who in outward appurtenances and
internal conceptions, condescended to assimilate her ideas and
manners with mine. Yet believe not that all my feelings are for
myself; my poor girls have sustained a loss far more extensive
than they, poor innocents! are at present sensible of. Unprovided
as I should have left them with respect to fortune, had it
been my fate to resign her and life first, I should have been under
no great apprehension for the welfare of my children, in leaving
them to a mother who had such inexhaustible resources in her
mind and intellects. It would have grieved me, indeed, to have
quitted her oppressed by such a load of care; but I could have

<span class="pagenum-block">[Pg 146]</span>

had no doubt of her supporting it with fortitude and abilities, as
long as life and health had been allowed her. Fortitude and
abilities she possessed, indeed, to a degree that, without hyperbole,
no human being can conceive but myself, who have seen
her under such severe trials as alone can manifest, unquestionably,
true parts and greatness of mind. I am thoroughly convinced
she was fitted for any situation, either exalted or humble,
which this life can furnish. And with all her nice discernment,
quickness of perception, and delicacy, she could submit, if occasion
seemed to require it, to such drudgery and toil as are suited
to the meanest domestic; and that, with a liveliness and alacrity
that, in general, are to be found in those only who have never
known a better state. Yet with a strength of reason the most
solid, and a capacity for literature the most intelligent, she never
for a moment relinquished the female and amiable softness of
her sex with which, above every other attribute, men are most
charmed and captivated.”</p>

<div class="topspace2"></div>

<p>Such, in their early effervescence, was the vent
which this man of affliction found to his sorrows, in
the sympathy of his affectionate friends.</p>

<p>At other times, they were beguiled from their
deadly heaviness by the expansion of fond description
in melancholy verse. To this he was less led
by poetical enthusiasm&mdash;for all of fire, fancy, and
imagery, that light up the poet’s flame, was now
extinct, or smothered&mdash;than by a gentle request of
his Esther, uttered in her last days, that he would

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 147]</span>

address to her some poetry; a request intended,
there can be no doubt, as a stimulus to some endearing
occupation that might tear him from his
first despondence, by an idea that he had still a
wish of hers to execute.</p>

<p>Not as poetry, in an era fastidious as the present
in metrical criticism, does the editor presume to
offer the verses now about to be selected and copied
from a vast mass of elegiac laments found amongst
the posthumous papers of Dr. Burney: it is biographically
alone, like those that have preceded them,
that they are brought forward. They are testimonies
of the purity of his love, as well as of the
acuteness of his bereavement; and, as such, they
certainly belong to his memoirs. The reader, therefore,
is again entreated to remember that they were
not designed for the press, though they were committed,
unshackled, to the discretion of the editor.
If that be in fault, the motive will probably prove a
palliative that will make the heart, not the head, of
the reader, the seat of his judgment.</p>

<p>A total chasm ensues of all account of events
belonging to the period of this irreparable earthly
blast. Not a personal memorandum of the unhappy
survivor is left; not a single document in his hand-writing,
except of verses to her idea, or to her memory;
or of imitations, adapted to his loss, and to her
excellences, from some selected sonnets of Petrarch,
whom he considered to have loved, entombed, and
bewailed another Esther in his Laura.</p>

<p>When this similitude, which soothed his spirit
and flattered his feelings, had been studied and
paralleled in every possible line of comparison,
he had recourse to the works of Dante, which, ere
long, beguiled from him some attention; because,
through the difficulty of idiom, he had not, as of
nearly all other favourite authors, lost all zest of
the beauties of Dante in solitude, from having

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 151]</span>

tasted the sweetness of his numbers with a pleasure
exalted by participation: for, during the last
two years that his Esther was spared to him, her
increased maternal claims from a new baby;<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and
augmented domestic cares from a new residence,
had checked the daily mutuality of their progress in
the pursuit of improvement; and to Esther this
great poet was scarcely known.</p>

<p>To Dante, therefore, he first delivered over what
he could yet summon from his grief-worn faculties;
and to initiate himself into the works, and nearly
obsolete style, of that hardest, but most sublime
of Italian poets, became the occupation to which,
with the least repugnance, he was capable of recurring.</p>

<p>A sedulous, yet energetic, though prose translation
of the Inferno, remains amongst his posthumous
relics, to demonstrate the sincere struggles
with which, even amidst this overwhelming calamity,
he strove to combat that most dangerously
consuming of all canker-worms upon life and virtue,
utter inertness.</p>

<p>Of his children, James,<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 152]</span>

his eldest son, had already, at ten years of age,
been sent to sea, a nominal midshipman, in the ship of
Admiral Montagu.</p>

<p>The second son, Charles,<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> who was placed, several
years later, in the Charterhouse, by Mr. Burney’s
first and constant patron, the Earl of Holdernesse,
was then but a child.</p>

<p>The eldest daughter was still a little girl; and
the last born of her three sisters could scarcely
walk alone. But all, save the seaman, who was
then aboard his ship, were now called back to the
paternal roof of the unhappy father.</p>

<p>None of them, however, were of an age to be
companionable; his fondness for them, therefore,
full of care and trouble, procured no mitigation to
his grief by the pleasure of society: and the heavy
march of time, where no solace is accepted from
abroad, or attainable at home, gave a species of
stagnation to his existence, that made him take,
in the words of Young,</p>

<div class="topspace1"></div>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse indent10">“No note of time,</div>
    <div class="verse">Save by its loss!”</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>His tenderness, however, as a father; his situation

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 153]</span>

as a man; and his duties as a Christian, drew, tore
him, at length, from this retreat of lonely woe;
and, in the manuscript already quoted from, which
was written many years after the period of which it
speaks, he says: “I was forced, ere long, to plunge
into business; and then found, that having my time
occupied by my affairs was a useful dissipation of
my sorrows, as it compelled me to a temporary
inattention to myself, and to the irreparable loss
I had sustained.”</p>

<p>Still, however, all mitigation to his grief that was
not imposed upon him by necessity, he avoided even
with aversion; and even the sight of those who
most had loved and esteemed the departed, was the
sight most painful to him in sharpening his regrets,
“which, therefore, no meeting whatsoever,” he
says, “could blunt; since to love and admire her,
had been universally the consequence of seeing and
knowing her.”</p>

<p>From this mournful monotony of life, he was
especially, however, called, by reflecting that his
eldest daughter was fast advancing to that age when
education is most requisite to improvement; and
that, at such a period, the loss of her mother and
instructress might be permanently hurtful to her, if

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 154]</span>

no measure should be taken to avert the possible
consequences of neglect.</p>

<p>Yet the idea of a governess, who, to him, unless his
children were wholly confined to the nursery, must
indispensably be a species of companion, was not, in
his present desolate state of mind, even tolerable.
Nevertheless masters without superintendence, and
lessons without practice, he well knew to be nugatory.
Projects how to remedy this evil, as fruitless as
they were numberless, crossed his mind; till a plan
occurred to him, that, by combining economy with
novelty, and change of scene for himself, with
various modes of advantage to his daughters, ripened
into an exertion that brought him, about a month
after its formation, to the gates of Paris.</p>

<p>The design of Mr. Burney was to place two of
his daughters in some convent, or boarding-house,
where their education might be forwarded by his
own directions.</p>

<p>Sundry reasons decided him to make his third
daughter, Susanna, take place, in this expedition, of
his second, Frances; but, amongst them, the principal
and most serious motive, was a fearful tendency
to a consumptive habit in that most delicate
of his young plants, that seemed to require the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 155]</span>

balsamic qualities of a warmer and clearer atmosphere.</p>

<p>Another reason, which he acknowledged, in after-times,
to have had great weight with him for this
arrangement, was the tender veneration with which
Frances was impressed for her maternal grandmother;
whose angelic piety, and captivating softness,
had won her young heart with such reverential
affection, that he apprehended there might be
danger of her being led to follow, even enthusiastically,
the religion of so pure a votary, if she should
fall so early, within the influence of any zealot in the
work of conversion. He determined, therefore, as
he could part with two of them only at a time, that
Fanny and Charlotte should follow their sisters in
succession, at a later period.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">PARIS.</h3>

<p>Immediately upon his arrival at Paris, Mr. Burney,
by singular good fortune, had the honour to
be introduced to Lady Clifford, a Roman Catholic
dowager, of a character the most benevolent, who
resided entirely in France, for the pious purpose of
enjoying with facility the rites of her religion, which

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 156]</span>

could not, at that period, be followed in England
without peril of persecution.</p>

<p>This lady took the children of Mr. Burney into
her kindest favour, and invited their father to consult
with her unreservedly upon his projects and
wishes; and, through such honourable auspices,
scarcely ten days elapsed, ere Esther and Susan
were placed under the care of Madame St. Mart, a
woman of perfect goodness of heart, and of a disposition
the most affectionate.</p>

<p>Madame St. Mart was accustomed to the charge
of <i lang="fr">des jeunes Anglaises</i>, two daughters of Sir
Willoughby Aston, Selina and Belinda, being then
under her roof.</p>

<p>Highly satisfied with this arrangement, Mr. Burney
now visited the delightful capital of France;
made himself acquainted with its antiquities, curiosities,
public buildings, public places, general laws,
and peculiar customs; its politics, its resources, its
festivities, its arts and its artists; as well as with the
arbitrary tyrannies, and degrading oppressions towards
the lower classes, which, at that epoch, were,
to an English looker-on, incomprehensibly combined,
not with murmurs nor discontent, but with
the most lively animal spirits, and the freshest glee
of national gaiety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 157]</span></p>

<p>But his chosen haunts were the Public Libraries,
to which an easiness of access, at that time deplorably
unknown in England, encouraged, nay, excited,
the intelligent visitor, who might be mentally
inclined to any literary project, to hit upon some
subject congenial to his taste; by rousing in him
that spirit of emulation, which ultimately animates
the humbly instructed, to soar to the heights that
distinguish the luminous instructor.</p>

<p>Collections of books, even the most multitudinous
and the most rare, may hold, to the common runner
through life, but an ordinary niche in places of
general resort; nevertheless, the Public Libraries,
those Patrons of the Mind, must always be entered
with a glow of grateful pleasure, by those who, instinctively,
meditate upon the vast mass of thought
that they contain.</p>

<p>To wander amidst those stores, that commit
talents to posterity as indubitably as the Herald’s
Register transmits names and titles; to develop
as accurately the systems of nations, the conditions
of communities, the progress of knowledge, and the
turn of men’s minds, two or three thousand years
ago, as in this our living minute; to visit, in fact,
the Brains of our fellow-creatures,&mdash;not alone with

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 158]</span>

the harrowing knife to dissect physical conformation,
but, with the piercing eye of penetration to dive
into the recesses of human intelligence, the sources
of imagination, and the springs of genius; and
there, in those sacred receptacles of mental remains,
to survey, in clear, indestructible evidence, all of the
soul that man is able to bequeath to man&mdash; &mdash;</p>

<p>Views such as these of the powers of his gifted,
though gone fellow-creatures, seen thus abstractedly
through their intellectual attributes; purified equally
from the frailties and selfishness of active life, and
the sickly humours and baleful infirmities of age;
seen through the medium of learned, useful, or fanciful
productions; and beheld in so insulated a
moment of vacuity of any positive plan of life,
instinctively roused the dormant faculties of the
subject of these memoirs, by setting before him a
comprehensive chart of human capabilities, which
involuntarily incited a conscious inquiry: what,
peradventure, might be his own share, if sought for,
in such heavenly gifts?</p>

<p>And it was now that, vaguely, yet powerfully,
he first fell into that stream of ideas, or visions,
that seemed to hail him to that class indefinable
and indescribable, from its mingled elevation and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 159]</span>

abjectness, which, by joining the publicity of the
press to the secret intercourse of the mind with
the pen, insensibly allures its adventurous votaries
to make the world at large the judge of their
abilities, or their deficiencies&mdash;namely, the class of
authors.</p>

<p>For this was the real, though not yet the ostensible
epoch, whence may be traced the opening of
his passion for literary pursuits.</p>

<p>And from this period, to the very close of his
long mortal career, this late, though newly chosen
occupation, became all that was most consoling to
his sorrows, most diversifying to his ideas, and most
animating to his faculties.</p>

<p>Some new stimulus had been eminently wanting
to draw a man of his natively ardent and aspiring
character from the torpid blight of availless misery;
which, in despoiling him of all bosom felicity, had
left only to an attempt at some untried project
and purpose, any chance for the restoration of his
energies.</p>

<p>He did not immediately fix on a subject for any
work, though he had the wisdom, at once, and the
modesty, to resolve, since so tardily he entered such
lists, to adopt no plan that might wean him from

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 160]</span>

his profession&mdash;for his profession was his whole
estate! but rather to seek one that might amalgamate
his rising desire of fame in literature, with
his original labours to be distinguished as a follower
of Orpheus.</p>

<p>He took notes innumerable in the public libraries,
which he meant to revisit on returning to Paris for
his daughters, of the books, subjects, passages, and
authors which invited re-perusal; and which, hereafter,
might happily conduct to some curious investigation,
or elucidating commentary.</p>

<p>He made himself master of a beautiful collection
of what then was esteemed to be most select of the
French classics.</p>

<p>He completed, by adding to what already he
possessed, all that recently had been published of
that noblest work that had yet appeared in the
republic of letters, the original Encyclopedia.</p>

<p>He opened an account with the reigning bookseller
of the day, whose reputation in his mind-enlightening
business still sustains its renown,
M. Guy, whom he commissioned to send over to
England the principal works then suspending over
the heights of the French Parnassus; where resplendently
were grouped all that was most attractive

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 161]</span>

in Wit, Poetry, Eloquence, Science, Pathos,
and Entertainment; from Rousseau, Voltaire,
d’Alembert, Marmontel, Destouches, Marivaux,
Gilbert, Diderot, Fontenelle, de Jaucourt; and
many others.</p>

<p>It will easily be conceived how wistfully Mr.
Burney must have coveted to make acquaintance
with this brilliant set; his high veneration for
genius having always led him to consider the first
sight of an eminent author to form a data in his
life.</p>

<p>But he had neither leisure, nor recommendatory
letters; nor, perhaps, courage for such an attempt;
the diffidence of his nature by no means anticipating
the honourable place he himself was destined to
hold in similar circles.</p>

<p>Not small, however, was his solace, while missing
every ray of living light from this foreign constellation,
when he found himself shone upon by a fixed
star of the first magnitude belonging to his own
system; for at the house of the English ambassador,
the Earl of Hertford, he became acquainted with
the celebrated secretary of his lordship, the justly
admired, and justly censured <span class="smcap">David Hume</span>; who,
with the skilful discernment that waited neither
name nor fame for its stimulus, took Mr. Burney

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 162]</span>

immediately and warmly into his favour.</p>

<p>Had this powerful and popular author, in his
erudite, spirited, and intellectual researches and
reflections, given to mankind his luminous talents,
and his moral philosophy, for fair, open, and useful
purposes, suited to the high character which he bore,
not alone for genius, but for worth and benevolence;
instead of bending, blending, involving them with
missive weapons of baneful sarcasm, insidiously at
work to undermine our form of faith; he would
have been hailed universally, not applauded partially,
as, in every point, one of the first of British writers.</p>

<p>To the world no man is accountable for his
thoughts and his ruminations; but for their propagation,
if they are dangerous or mischievous, the risks
which he may allure others to share, seem impelled
by wanton lack of feeling; if not by an ignorant yet
presumptuous dearth of foresight to the effect he is
working to produce: two deficiencies equally impossible
to be attributed to a man to whom philanthropy
is as unequivocally accorded as philosophy.</p>

<p>Unsolved therefore, perhaps, yet remains, as a
problem in the history of human nature, how a
being, at once wise and benign, could have refrained

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 163]</span>

from the self-examination of demanding: what&mdash;had
he been successful in exterminating from the
eyes and the hearts of men the lecture and the
doctrines of the Holy Scriptures, would have been
achieved? Had he any other more perfect religion
to offer? More purifying from evil? more fortifying
in misfortune? more consoling in woe?&mdash;No!&mdash;indubitably
no!&mdash;Nothing fanatical, or mystic, could
cope with judgment such as his. To undermine,
not to construct, is all the obvious purpose of his
efforts&mdash;of which he laments the failure as a calamity!<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
He leaves, therefore, nothing to conjecture
of his motives but what least seems to belong to a
character of his sedate equanimity; a personal desire
to proclaim to mankind their folly in their belief,
and his sagacity in his infidelity.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">LONDON.</h3>

<p>Mr. Burney now, greatly lightened, and somewhat
brightened in spirits, returned to his country
and his home. His mind seemed no longer left in
desolating inertness to prey upon itself. Nutriment

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 164]</span>

of an invigorating nature was in view, though not
yet of a consistence to afford spontaneous refreshment.
On the contrary, it required taste for selection,
labour for culture, and skill for appropriation.
But such nutriment, if attainable, was precisely that
which best could re-inforce the poor “tenement of
clay,”<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> which the lassitude of unbraced nerves had
nearly “fretted to decay.”</p>

<p>Sketches, hints, notes, and scattered ideas of all
sorts, began to open the way to some original composition;
though the timidity of his Muse, not the
dearth of his fancy, long kept back the force of
mind for meeting the public eye, that now, in these
more easy, dauntless times, urges almost every
stripling to present his mental powers to the world,
nearly ere his physical ones have emerged from leading-strings
in the nursery.</p>

<p>The first, because the least responsible, method of
facing the critic eye, that occurred to him, was that
of translation; and he began with acutely studying
d’Alembert’s <i lang="fr">El&eacute;mens de Musique th&eacute;orique et
pratique, selon les principes de Rameau</i>; in
which he was assiduously engaged, when the appearance
of the celebrated musical <i lang="fr">Dictionaire</i> of the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 165]</span>

still more celebrated Rousseau, from its far nearer
congeniality to his taste, surprised him into inconstancy.</p>

<p>Yet this also, from circumstances that intervened,
was laid aside; and his first actual essay was a
trifle, though a pleasing one, from which no real
fame could either accrue, or be marred; it was translating,
and adapting to the stage, the little pastoral

<h3 class="nobreak">GARRICK.</h3>

<p>To this he was urged by Garrick; and the execution
was appropriate, and full of merit. But
though the music, from its simplicity and the
sweetness of its melody, was peculiarly fitted to
refine the public taste amongst the middle classes;
while it could not fail to give passing pleasure even
to the highest; the drama was too denuded of
intricacy or variety for the amusement of John Bull;
and the appearance of only three interlocuters
caused a gaping expectation of some followers, that
made every new scene begin by inflicting disappointment.</p>

<p>Mr. Garrick, and his accomplished, high-bred,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 166]</span>

and engaging wife, La Violetta, had been amongst
the earliest of the pristine connexions of Mr. Burney,
who had sought him, with compassionate kindness,
as soon after his heart-breaking loss as he could
admit any friends to his sight. The ensuing paragraph
on his warm sentiments of this talented and
bewitching pair, is copied from one of his manuscript
memorandums.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“My acquaintance, at this time, with Mrs. as well as Mr.
Garrick, was improved into a real friendship; and frequently,
on the Saturday night, when Mr. Garrick did not act, he carried
me to his villa at Hampton, whence he brought me to my home
early on Monday morning. I seldom was more happy than in
these visits. His wit, humour, and constant gaiety at home;
and Mrs. Garrick’s good sense, good breeding, and obliging
desire to please, rendered their Hampton villa, on these occasions,
a terrestrial paradise.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Garrick had every faculty of social judgment, good
taste, and steadiness of character, which he wanted. She was
an excellent appreciator of the fine arts; and attended all the
last rehearsals of new or of revived plays, to give her opinion
of effects, dresses, scenery, and machinery. She seemed to be
his real other half; and he, by his intelligence and accomplishments,
seemed to complete the Hydroggynus.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This eminent couple paid their court to Mr.
Burney in the manner that was most sure to be
successful, namely, by their endearing and good natured

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 167]</span>

attentions to his young family; frequently
giving them, with some chaperon of their father’s
appointing, the lightsome pleasure of possessing
Mrs. Garrick’s private box at Drury Lane Theatre;
and that, from time to time, even when the incomparable
Roscius acted himself; which so enchanted
their gratitude, that they nearly&mdash;as Mr. Burney
laughingly quoted to Garrick from Hudibras&mdash;</p>

    <div class="verse">Worship the shadow of his shoe-tie.”</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Garrick, who was passionately fond of children,
never withheld his visits from Poland-street on account
of the absence of the master of the house;
for though it was the master he came to seek, he
was too susceptible to his own lively gift of bestowing
pleasure, to resist witnessing the ecstacy he was
sure to excite, when he burst in unexpectedly upon
the younger branches: for so playfully he individualised
his attentions, by an endless variety of comic
badinage,&mdash;now exhibited in lofty bombast; now in
ludicrous obsequiousness; now by a sarcasm skilfully
implying a compliment; now by a compliment
archly conveying a sarcasm; that every happy day
that gave them but a glimpse of this idol of their

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 168]</span>

juvenile fancy, was exhilarated to its close by reciprocating
anecdotes of the look, the smile, the
bow, the shrug, the start, that, after his departure,
each enraptured admirer could describe.</p>

<p>A circumstance of no small weight at that time,
contributed to allure Mr. Garrick to granting these
joyous scenes to the young Burney tribe. When
he made the tour of Italy, for the recovery of his
health, and the refreshment of his popularity, he
committed to the care of Mr. Burney and his young
family his own and Mrs. Garrick’s favourite little
dog, Phill, a beautiful black and white spaniel, of
King Charles’s breed, luxuriant in tail and mane,
with the whitest breast, and spotted with perfect
symmetry.</p>

<p>The fondness of Mr. Garrick for this little spaniel
was so great, that one of his first visits on his
return from the continent was to see, caress, and
reclaim him. Phill was necessarily resigned, though
with the most dismal reluctance, by his new friends:
but if parting with the favoured little quadruped
was a disaster, how was that annoyance overpaid,
when, two or three days afterwards, Phill re-appeared!
and when the pleasure of his welcome to
the young folks was increased by a message, that

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 169]</span>

the little animal had seemed so moping, so unsettled,
and so forlorn, that Mr. and Mrs. Garrick
had not the heart to break his new engagements,
and requested his entire acceptance and adoption in
Poland-street.</p>

<p>During the life of this favourite, all the juvenile
group were sought and visited together, by the
gay-hearted Roscius; and with as much glee as he
himself was received by these happy young creatures,
whether two-footed or four.</p>

<p>On the first coming-out of the “Cunning Man,”
Mr. Garrick, who undoubtedly owed his unequalled
varieties in delineating every species of comic character,
to an inquisitive observance of Nature in all
her workings, amused himself in watching from the
orchestra, where he frequently sat on the first night
of new pieces, the young auditory in Mrs. Garrick’s
box; and he imitatingly described to Mr. Burney
the innocent confidence of success with which they
all openly bent forward, to look exultingly at the
audience, when a loud clapping followed the overture:
and their smiles, or nods: or chuckling and
laughter, according to their more or less advanced
years, during the unmingled approbation that was
bestowed upon about half the piece&mdash;contrasted

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 170]</span>

with, first the amazement; next, the indignation;
and, lastly, the affright and disappointment, that
were brought forth by the beginning buzz of hissing,
and followed by the shrill horrors of the catcall:
and then the return&mdash;joyous, but no longer dauntless!&mdash;of
hope, when again the applause prevailed.</p>

<p>In these various changes, Mr. Garrick altered
the expression of his features, and almost his features
themselves, by apparent transformations&mdash;which,
however less poetical, were at least more
natural than those of Ovid.</p>

<p>Mr. Garrick possessed not only every possible
inflexion of voice, save for singing, but also of
countenance; varying his looks into young, old,
sick, vigorous, downcast, or frolicsome, at his personal
volition; as if his face, and even his form, had
been put into his own hands to be worked upon like
Man a Machine.</p>

<p>Mr. Garrick, about this time, warmly urged the
subject of these memoirs to set to music an English
opera called Orpheus; but while, for that purpose,
Mr. Burney was examining the drama, he was
informed that it had been put into the hands of
Mr. Barthelemon, who was preparing it for the stage.</p>

<p>Astonished, and very much hurt, Mr. Burney

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 171]</span>

hastily returned the copy with which he had been
entrusted, to Mr. Johnstone, the prompter; dryly,
and without letter or comment, directing him to
deliver it to Mr. Garrick.</p>

<p>Mr. Garrick, with the utmost animation, instantly
wrote to Johnstone an apology rather than a justification;
desiring that the opera should be withdrawn
from Mr. Barthelemon, and consigned wholly to
the subject of these memoirs; for whom Mr. Garrick
declared himself to entertain a friendship that nothing
should dissolve.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>But Mr. Burney, conceiving that Barthelemon,
who had offended no one, and who bore a most
amiable character, might justly resent so abrupt a
discharge, declined setting the opera: and never
afterwards composed for the theatres.</p>

<p>This trait, however trifling, cannot but be considered
as biographical, at least for Mr. Garrick;
as it so strongly authenticates the veracity of the
two principal lines of the epitaph designed for
Roscius, many years afterwards, by that acute observer
of every character&mdash;save his own!&mdash;Dr.
Goldsmith.</p>

  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 172]</span></p>

<p>Whether negligence, mistake, or caprice, had
occasioned this double nomination to the same office,
is not clear; but Garrick, who loved Mr. Burney
with real affection, lost no time, and spared no
blandishment, to re-instate himself in the confidence
which this untoward accident had somewhat shaken.
And he had full success, to the great satisfaction
of Mr. Burney, and joy of his family; who all rapturously
delighted in the talents and society of the
immortal Roscius.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">MR. CRISP.</h3>

<p>While this revival of intercourse with the Garricks,
and partial return to public life and affairs,
necessarily banished the outward and obvious marks
of the change of existence, and lost happiness of
Mr. Burney, they operated also, gently, but effectively,
in gradually diminishing his sufferings, by
forcing him from their contemplation: for in that
dilapidated state of sorrow’s absorption, where the
mind is wholly abandoned to its secret sensations,
all that innately recurs to it can spring only from
its own concentrated sources; and these, though
they may vary the evil by palliatives, offer nothing
curative. New scenes and objects alone can open

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 173]</span>

to new ideas; and, happily, a circumstance now occurred
that brought on a revival of intercourse with
the only man who, at that time, could recall the
mourner’s faculties to genial feelings, and expand
them to confidential sociality.</p>

<p>His earliest favourite, guide, philosopher, and
friend, Mr. Crisp, he now, after a separation of very
many years, accidentally met at the house of
Mr. Vincent, a mutual acquaintance.</p>

<p>Their satisfaction at the sight of each other was
truly reciprocal; though that of Mr. Burney was
tinctured with dejection, that he could no longer
present to his dearest friend the partner whom, by
such a judge, he had felt would have been instantly
and reverentially appreciated.</p>

<p>Mr. Crisp joined in this regret; but was not the
less desirous to see and to know all that remained of
her; and he hastened the following day to Poland-street;
where, from his very first entrance amidst
the juvenile group, he became instinctively honoured
as a counsellor for his wisdom and judgment, and
loved and liked as a companion for his gaiety, his
good-humour, and his delight in their rising affections;
which led him unremittingly, though never
obtrusively, to mingle instruction with their most
sportive intercourse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 174]</span></p>

<p>As Mr. Crisp was the earliest and dearest friend
of the subject of these memoirs, the reader will not,
it is probable, be sorry to be apprised of the circumstances
which, since their separation, had turned
him from a brilliant man of the world to a decided
recluse.</p>

<p>The life of Mr. Crisp had been exposed to much
vicissitude. Part of it had been spent in Italy,
particularly at Rome, where he took up his residence
for some years; and where, from his passion
for music, painting, and sculpture, he amassed, for
the rest of his existence, recollections of never-dying
pleasure. And not alone for his solitary contemplations,
but for the delight that the vivacity of
his delineations imparted to his friends, when he
could be induced to unfold his reminiscences; whether
upon the sacred and soul-pervading harmony
of the music of the Pope’s chapel; or upon the tones,
mellifluously melting or elevating, of Sinesino,
Custini, or Farinelli: or by bringing to view
through glowing images, the seraphic forms and
expressions of Raphael and Correggio; and the
sculptural sublimity of Michael Angelo. Or when,
animated to the climax of his homage for the fine
arts, he flitted by all else to concentrate the whole

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 175]</span>

force of his energies, in describing that electrifying
wonder, the Apollo Belvedere.</p>

<p>On this he dwelt with a vivacity of language that
made his hearers wish to fasten upon every word
that he uttered; so vividly he portrayed the commanding
port, the chaste symmetry, and the magic
form&mdash;for which not a tint was requisite, and colouring
would have been superfluous&mdash;of that unrivalled
production, of which the peerless grace, looking
softer, though of marble, than the feathered snow;
and brightly radiant, though, like the sun, simply
white, strike upon the mind rather than the eye, as
an ideal representative of ethereal beauty.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>And while such were his favourite topics for his
gifted participators, there was a charm for all around
in his more general conversation, that illumined
with instruction, or gladdened with entertainment,
even the most current and desultory subjects of the
passing hour.</p>

<p>Thus rarely at once endowed and cultivated,
there can be little surprise that Mr. Crisp should
be distinguished, speedily and forcibly, by what is

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 176]</span>

denominated the Great World; where his striking
talents, embellished by his noble countenance and
elegant manners, made him so much the mode with
the great, and the chosen with the difficult, that
time, not friends, was all he wanted for social
enjoyment.</p>

<p>High, perhaps highest in this noble class, stood
Margaret Cavendish Harley, Duchess Dowager of
Portland, <em>The Friend of Mrs. Delany</em>; by whom
that venerable and exemplary personage, who was
styled by Mr. Burke, “The pattern of a real fine
lady of times that were past,” had been herself
made known to Mr. Crisp.</p>

<p>Mrs. Montagu, also, who then, Mr. Crisp was
wont to say, was peering at fame, and gradually
rising to its temple, was of the same coterie. But
most familiarly he resided with Christopher Hamilton
of Chesington Hall, and with the Earl of
Coventry.</p>

<p>With this last he was intimately connected, at the
time of that Earl’s marriage with the acknowledged
nonpareil of female beauty, the youngest Miss
Gunning.</p>

<p>Mr. Crisp had already written his tragedy of
Virginia; but Garrick, though he was the author’s

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 177]</span>

personal friend, thought it so little equal to the
expectations that might await it, that he postponed,
season after season, bringing it out; even though
Lord Coventry, who admired it with the warmth
of partial regard, engaged the first Mr. Pitt<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> to
read it, and to pronounce in its favour. Roscius
still was adverse, and still delayed the trial; nor
could he be prevailed upon to prepare it for the
stage, till Mr. Crisp had won that Venus of her
day, the exquisite Lady Coventry, through his
influence with her lord, to present a copy of the
manuscript, with her own almost sculptured hand,
to the then conquered manager.</p>

<p>The play neither succeeded nor failed. A catastrophe
of so yea and nay a character was ill suited
to the energies and hopes of its high-minded
author, who was bitterly disappointed; and thought
the performers had been negligent, Mr. Garrick
unfriendly, and the public precipitate.</p>

<p>The zealous Lord Coventry, himself a man of
letters, advised sundry changes, and a new trial.
Mr. Crisp shut himself up, and worked indefatigably
at these suggestions: but when his alterations were

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 178]</span>

finished, there was no longer a radiant Countess of
Coventry to bewitch Mr. Garrick, by “the soft
serenity of her smile,” to make a further attempt.
Lady Coventry, whose brief, dazzling race, was
rapidly run, was now already fast fading in the
grasping arms of withering consumption: and Mr.
Garrick, though, from unwillingness to disoblige,
he seemed wavering, was not the less inexorable.</p>

<p>Mr. Crisp then, disgusted with the stage, the
manager, and the theatrical public, gave up not
alone that point, but every other by which he
might have emerged from private life to celebrity.
He almost wholly retired from London, and resided
at Hampton; where he fitted up a small
house with paintings, prints, sculpture, and musical
instruments, arranged with the most classical
elegance.</p>

<p>But the vicinity of the metropolis caused allurements
such as these, with such a chief to bring
them into play, to accord but ill with the small,
though unincumbered fortune of their master; and
the grace with which, instinctively, he received
his visitors, made his habitation so pleasant, as
soon to produce a call upon his income that shattered
its stability.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 179]</span></p>

<p>His alarm now was such as might be expected
from his sense of honour, and his love of independence.
Yet the delicacy of his pride forbade any
complaint to his friends, that might seem to implicate
their discretion in his distress, or to invite
their aid; though his desire to smooth, without
publishing, his difficulties, urged him to commune
with those of his connexions who were in actual
power, and to confess his wishes for some honourable
place, or occupation, that might draw forth his
faculties to the amelioration of his fortune.</p>

<p>Kind words, and enlivening promises, now raised
his hopes to a favourable change in his affairs; and,
brightly looking forward, he continued to welcome
his friends; who, enchanted by his society, poured
in upon him with a thoughtless frequency, which
caused an increase of expenditure that startled him,
ere long, with a prospect, sudden and frightful, of
the road to ruin.</p>

<p>Shocked, wounded, dismayed, he perceived two
ways only by which he could be extricated from
the labyrinth into which he had been betrayed by
premature expectation; either vigorously to urge
his suit for some appointment, and persecute, pester
his friends to quicken his advancement; or cut off

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 180]</span>

approaching worldly destruction by an immediate
sacrifice of worldly luxury.</p>

<p>A severe fit of the gout, that now, for the first
time&mdash;hastened, probably, by chagrin&mdash;assailed
him, decided his resolution. He sold his house at
Hampton, his books, prints, pictures, and instruments;
with a fixed determination of relinquishing
the world, and retiring from mankind.</p>

<p>Within a few miles of Hampton stood Chesington
Hall, his chosen retreat; and thither, with what
little of his property he had rescued from the
auctioneer and the appraiser, he transplanted his
person; and there buried every temporal prospect.</p>

<p>Chesington Hall was placed upon a considerable,
though not rapid eminence, whence two tall, antique
trees, growing upon an old rustic structure called
The Mount, were discernible at sixteen miles distance.
The Hall had been built upon a large,
lone, and nearly desolate common; and no regular
road, or even track to the mansion from Epsom,
the nearest town, had, for many years, been spared
from its encircling ploughed fields, or fallow ground.</p>

<p>This old mansion had fallen into the hands of
the Hamiltons from those of the Hattons, by whom
its erection had been begun in the same year upon

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 181]</span>

which Cardinal Wolsey had commenced raising,
in its vicinity, the magnificent palace of Hampton
Court.</p>

<p>Every thing around Chesington Hall was now
falling to decay; and its hereditary owner, Christopher
Hamilton, the last male of his immediate
branch of the Hamilton family, was, at this time,
utterly ruined, and sinking in person as well as
property in the general desolation.</p>

<p>This was precisely a sojourn to meet the secluding
desire of Mr. Crisp; he adopted some pic-nic plan
with Mr. Hamilton; and Chesington Hall became
his decided residence; it might almost be said, his
fugitive sanctuary. He acquainted no one with his
intentions, and communicated to no one his place of
abode. Firm to resist the kindness, he determined
to escape the tediousness, of persuasion: and, however
often, in after-life, when renovated health
gave him a consciousness of renovated faculties, he
might have regretted this intellectual interment, he
was immoveable never more to emerge from a tranquillity,
which now, to his sickened mind, made the
pursuits of ambition seem as oppressively troublesome
in their man&oelig;uvres, as they were morbidly
bitter in their disappointments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 182]</span></p>

<p>His fondness, however, for the arts, was less subordinate
to the casualties of life than his love of the
world. It was too much an integral part of his
composition to be annihilated in the same gulph in
which were sunk his mundane expectations. Regularly,
therefore, every spring, he came up to the
metropolis, where, in keeping pace with the times,
he enjoyed every modern improvement in music and
painting.</p>

<p>Rarely can a re-union of early associates have
dispensed brighter felicity with more solid advantages,
than were produced by the accidental re-meeting
of these long separated friends. To Mr.
Burney it brought back a congeniality of feeling
and intelligence, that re-invigorated his social virtues;
and to Mr. Crisp it gave not only a friend,
but a family.</p>

<p>It operated, however, no further. To Mr. Burney
alone was confided the clue for a safe route
across the wild common to Chesington Hall; from
all others it was steadfastly withheld; and from Mr.
Greville it was studiously and peculiarly concealed.</p>

<p>That gentleman now was greatly altered, from
the large and larger strides which he had made, and
was making, into the dangerous purlieus of horse-racing

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 183]</span>

and of play; into whose precincts, from the
delusive difference of their surface from their foundation,
no incursions can be hazarded without as
perilous a shake to character and disposition, as to
fortune and conduct. And Mr. Greville, who,
always honourable, was almost necessarily a frequent
loser, was evidently on the high road to turn from
a man of pleasure to a man of spleen; venting his
wrath at his failures upon the turf and at the clubs,
by growing fastidious and cavilling in general society.
Mr. Crisp, therefore, bent to maintain the
dear bought quiet of his worldly sacrifices as unmingled
with the turbulent agitations of querulous
debate, as with the restless solicitudes of active
life, shunned the now pertinacious disputant almost
with dread.</p>

<p>Yet Mr. Greville, about this period, was rescued,
for a while, from this hovering deterioration, through
the exertions of his friends in the government, by
whom he was named minister plenipotentiary to the
court of Bavaria; in the hope that such an appointment,
with its probable consequences, might re-establish
his affairs.</p>

<p>No change, however, of situation, caused any

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 184]</span>

change in Mr. Greville to his early <i lang="fr">proteg&eacute;</i> and
attached and attaching friend, Mr. Burney, to
whom he still shewed himself equally eager to communicate
his opinions, and reveal his proceedings.
A letter from Munich, written when his Excellency
was first installed in his new dignity, will display
the pleasant openness of their correspondence; at
the same time that it depicts the humours and
expenses of the official ceremonials then in use,
with a frankness that makes them both curious and
entertaining.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A letter to the Earl of Eglinton from the celebrated
David Hume, written also about this time,
gave Mr. Burney very peculiar satisfaction, from the
sincere disposition to esteem and to serve him, which
it manifested in that dangerously renowned philosopher;
whose judgment of men was as skilfully inviting,
as his sophistry in theology was fearfully repelling.</p>

<p>Yet upon the circumstances of this letter hung a
cutting disappointment, which, in the midst of his
rising prospects, severely pierced the hopes of Mr.
Burney; and, from the sharpness of its injury, and
its future aggravating repetitions, would permanently

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 185]</span>

have festered them, had their composition been of
less elastic quality.</p>

<p>To be Master of the King’s Band, as the highest
professional honour to be obtained, had been the
earliest aim of Mr. Burney; and, through the medium
of warm friends, joined to his now well approved
and obvious merit, the promise of the then
Lord Chamberlain had been procured for the first
vacancy. This arrived in 1765; but when the
consequent claim was made, how great, how confounding
to Mr. Burney was the intelligence, that
the place was disposed of already.</p>

<p>He hastened with a relation of this grievance, as
unexpected as it was undeserved, to the celebrated
historian, to whom his rights had been well known
at Paris. And Mr. Hume, whose sense of justice&mdash;one
fatal warp excepted&mdash;was as luminous as it was
profound, shocked by such a breach of its simplest
and most unchangeable statutes, instantly undertook,
with the courage imbibed by his great abilities
and high moral character, to make a representation
on the subject to Lord Hertford.</p>

<p>Failing, however, of meeting with an immediate
opportunity, and well aware of the importance of
expedition in such applications, he addressed himself

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 186]</span>

to the Countess; and from her he learnt, and
with expressions of benevolent concern, that it was
the Duke of York<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> who had demanded the nomination
to the place.</p>

<p>It now occurred to Mr. Hume that the present
applicant might possibly be himself the object
for whom his Royal Highness had interfered, as
Mr. Burney had frequently been seen, and treated
with marked kindness, by the Royal Duke at private
concerts; which were then often, at the sudden request
of that prince, formed by the Earl of Eglinton;
and at which Mr. Burney, when in London,
was always a principal and favoured assistant. With
this in his recollection, and naturally concluding
Lord Eglinton, who always shewed an animated
partiality for Mr. Burney, to be chief in the application
to the Lord Chamberlain, Mr. Hume wrote the
following letter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center smcap">To the Earl of Eglinton.</p>

<div class="topspace2"></div>

<p class="sig-left5 smcap">“My Lord,<br /></p>

<p>“Not finding an opportunity of speaking yesterday to Lord
Hertford, in favour of Mr. Burney, I spoke to my lady, and told
her the whole case. She already knows Mr. Burney, and has an
esteem for him. She said it gave her great uneasiness, and was

<span class="pagenum-block">[Pg 187]</span>

sure it would do so to my lord, that he was already engaged, and,
she believed, to the Duke of York.</p>

<p>“It occurred to me, that his Royal Highness’s application
might, also, be in favour of Mr. Burney; in which case the
matter is easy. If not, it is probable your Lordship may engage
his Royal Highness to depart from his application; for really Mr.
Burney’s case, independently of his merit, is very hard and cruel.</p>

<div class="topspace2"></div>

<p>A reclamation such as this, from a man who was
then almost universally held to be at the head of
British literature, could not be read unmoved; and
an opinion so positive of the justice and merits of
the case, manifested by two directions for an immediate
reply, both given for the same day, and without
any apology for such precipitancy, shewed a warmth

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 188]</span>

of personal zeal and interest for the welfare of Mr.
Burney, that was equally refreshing to his spirits,
and stimulating to his hopes.</p>

<p>The place, however, was decidedly gone. The
first word from the Duke had fixed its fate; though,
from the real amenity of the character of the prince,
joined to the previous favour he had shewn to Mr.
Burney, there cannot be a doubt that, had the history
of the affair reached the ear of his Royal Highness,
he would have been foremost himself, as Mr.
Hume suggested, to have nominated Mr. Burney.</p>

<p>Here the matter dropped; and the expressed
regret and civilities of the Countess, with the implied
ones of the Earl, somewhat softened the infliction:
but the active services, and manly appeal of David
Hume, conduced far more to awaken and to fortify
the philosophy that so unexpected a mortification
required.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In mingling again with the world upon its common
terms of cultivating what was good, and supporting
what was evil, Mr. Burney now, no longer bewitched
by beauty, nor absorbed by social sympathies, found
literature and its pursuits without rival in his estimation;
yet, in missing those vanished delights, he
deemed that he had the world to re-begin: for
though prosperity met his professional toils with
heightened reputation and reward, they were joyless,
however essential, since participation was gone!</p>

<p>The time had arrived, and now was passed, for the
long-settled project of Mr. Burney of conveying to

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 189]</span>

Paris his second and, then, youngest daughters,
Frances and Charlotte, to replace his eldest and his
third, Esther and Susanna; now both returned
thence, with every improvement that a kind parent
could reasonably desire.</p>

<p>The time had arrived&mdash;and was passed.&mdash;But if
no man can with certainty pronounce what at any
stated period he will perform, how much less is he
gifted with fore-knowledge of what, at any stated
period, he may wish!</p>

<p>Six heartless, nearly desolate, years of lonely conjugal
chasm, had succeeded to double their number
of nearly unparalleled conjugal enjoyment&mdash;and the
void was still fallow and hopeless!&mdash;when the yet
very handsome, though no longer in her bloom,
Mrs. Stephen Allen, of Lynn, now become a widow,
decided, for promoting the education of her eldest
daughter, to make London her winter residence.</p>

<p>Mr. Burney was, of course, applied to for assistance
in the musical line; and not less called upon as
the most capable judge and counsellor in every other.</p>

<p>The loss that had been sustained by Mrs. Allen
was that of a very worthy man, whom she esteemed,
but to whom she had been married by her parents
early in life, without either choice or aversion. In
her situation, therefore, and that of Mr. Burney,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 190]</span>

there was no other affinity than that each had been
widowed by the hand of death.</p>

<p>Highly intellectual, and fond even to passion of
books, Mrs. Allen delighted in the conversation of
Mr. Burney; and the hour for his instructions to
Miss Allen was fixed to be that of tea-time; to the
end that, when he was liberated from the daughter,
he might be engaged with the mother.</p>

<p>The superior grief of Mr. Burney, as deep as it
was acute, was not more prominent than the feeling
admiration that it inspired in Mrs. Allen: and if
moved by his sorrows, while charmed by his merit,
Mrs. Allen saw him with daily increasing interest,
Mr. Burney was not less moved by her commiseration,
nor less penetrated by her sympathy; and
insensibly he became solaced, while involuntarily she
grew grateful, upon observing her rising influence
over his spirits.</p>

<p>To the tender sentiments of the heart, the avenues
are as infinite for entrance as they are difficult for
escape; but there are none so direct, and, consequently,
none so common, as those through whose
gentle mazes soft pity encounters soothing sensibility.</p>

<p>The task of consoling the sorrower seems, to its
participator, nearly a devout one; and the sorrower,
most especially where beauty and spirit meet in that

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 191]</span>

participator, would think resistance to such benevolence
might savour of ingratitude.</p>

<p>Those who judge of the sincerity of pristine connubial
tenderness merely by its abhorrence of succession,
take a very unenlightened, if not false, view
of human grief; unless they limit their stigma to
an eager or a facile repetition of those rites which,
on their first inauguration, had seemed inviolable
and irreplaceable.</p>

<p>So still, in fact, they may faithfully, though
silently continue, even under a subsequent new
connexion. The secret breast, alive to memory
though deprived of sympathy, may still internally
adhere to its own choice and fondness; notwithstanding
the various and imperious calls of current
existence may urge a second alliance: and urge it,
from feelings and from affections as clear of inconstancy
as of hypocrisy; urge it, from the best of
motives, that of accommodating ourselves to our
lot, with all its piercing privations; since our lot
is dependent upon causes we have no means to
either evade or fathom; and as remote from our
direction as from our wishes.</p>

<p>If, by any exertion of which mortal man is capable,
or any suffering which mortal man can sustain,
Mr. Burney could have called back his vanished

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 192]</span>

Esther to his ecstatic consciousness, labour, even to
decrepitude, endurance even to torture, he would
have borne, would have sought, would have blessed,
for the most transient sight of her adored form.
But she was taken away from him by that decree
against which there is no appeal.</p>

<p>He who loses a parent, a brother, a sister, a
friend, however deeply and deservedly they may
be lamented, is never branded with want of feeling
if he seek another counsellor and guide, if he accept
another companion and favourite. It is but considered
to be meeting his destiny as a man who
knows he must not choose it; it is but consenting
to receive such good as is attainable, while bowing
down submissively to such evil as is unavoidable.</p>

<p>Succession is the law of nature; and, as far as
her laws are obvious, it is that which stands
foremost.</p>

<p>The angel whom Mr. Burney had lost&mdash;for an
angel both without and within she had seemed to
him&mdash;had the generous disinterestedness, on the
bed of death, to recommend to her miserable husband
that he would marry again; well knowing
that the tenderness of female friendship would come
nearest,&mdash;however distant,&mdash;to the softness of consolation:
and, maternally weighing, no doubt, that

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 193]</span>

a well chosen partner might prove a benediction to
her poor children. And this injunction, though
heard at the time with agony scarcely supportable,
might probably, and strongly, influence his future
conduct, when the desperation of hopelessness was
somewhat worn away by all-subduing time, joined
to forced exertions in business.</p>

<p>His Esther had even named to him the lady
whom she thought most capable to suit him as a
companion, and most tenderly disposed to becoming
a mother to his children,&mdash;Miss Dorothy Young,
who was her most valued friend. Mrs. Allen, Dorothy’s
nearest competitor, was not then a widow.
But Mr. Burney, sacred as he held the opinions and
the wishes of his Esther, was too ardent an admirer
of beauty to dispense, in totality, with that attractive
embellishment of the female frame. He
honoured and esteemed, with a brother’s affection,
the excellent Dorothy Young: but those
charms which awaken softer sensations, were utterly
and unhappily denied to that estimable woman,
through her peculiarly unfortunate personal defects.</p>

<p>Not early, and not easily, did Mr. Burney and
Mrs. Allen reveal their mutual partiality. The
wounded heart of Mr. Burney recoiled from such

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 194]</span>

anodyne as demanded new vows to a new object:
and Mrs. Allen, at that period, lived in a state of
affluence that made such a marriage require severe
worldly sacrifices. Only, however transiently; for
by an unfortunate trust in an unfortunate, though
honourable speculatist, Dr. King, she completely
lost all that, independently, was at her own disposal
of fortune. And the noble disinterestedness of
Mr. Burney upon this occasion, rivetted to him
her affections, with the highest esteem.</p>

<p>Yet even when these scruples were mutually overwhelmed
by increasing force of regard, so many
unlooked for obstacles stood in the way of their
union, that, wearied by delays that seemed at once
captious and interminable, Mr. Burney earnestly
entreated that an immediate private marriage might
avert, at least, a final breach of their engagement:
solemnly promising, at the same time, that they
should keep the alliance secret, and still live apart,
till all prudential exactions should be satisfied.</p>

<p>As they were each wholly independent, save
from the influence of opinion,&mdash;which, however, is
frequently more difficult to subdue than that of
authority,&mdash;Mrs. Allen saw no objection of sufficient
force to counteract her pleasure in compliance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 195]</span></p>

<p>Their plan was confided to four persons, indispensably
requisite for its execution; Mrs., afterwards
Lady Strange, Miss Young, Mr. Crisp, and the
Rev. Mr. Pugh, curate of St. James’s church.</p>

<p>Mr. Pugh, who was of very long standing a
friend of Mr. Burney, aided personally in promoting
such measures as secured secrecy with success; and
in St. James’s church, Mr. Pugh tied that indissoluble
knot, which, however fairly promising, is inevitably
rigorous, since it can be loosened only by
Crime or by Death: but which, where it binds the
destinies of those whose hearts are already knit
together by reciprocated regard, gives a charm to
captivity that robs liberty of regret.</p>

<p>At the porch of St. James’s church, Mrs. Strange
and Mr. Pugh whispered their congratulations to
the new married couple, as they entered a prepared
post-chaise; which, in a very few hours, galloped
them to the obscure skirts of the then pathless,
and nearly uninhabited, Chesington common; where
Mr. Crisp had engaged for them a rural and fragrant
retreat, at a small farm-house in a little
hamlet, a mile or two from Chesington Hall.</p>

<p>The secret, as usual in matrimonial concealments,
was faithfully preserved, for a certain time, by

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 196]</span>

scrupulous discretion in the parties, and watchful
circumspection in the witnesses: but, as usual also,
error and accident were soon at work to develop
the transaction; and the loss of a letter, through
some carelessness of conveyance, revealed suddenly
but irrevocably the state of the connexion.</p>

<p>This circumstance, however, though, at the time,
cruelly distressing, served ultimately but to hasten
their own views; as the discovery was necessarily
followed by the personal union for which their hands
had been joined.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burney,&mdash;now no longer Mrs. Stephen
Allen&mdash;came openly to town to inhabit, for a while,
a house in Poland-street, a few doors from that of
her husband; while alterations, paintings, and embellishments
were progressively preparing the way
for her better reception at his home.</p>

<p>The two families, however, awaited not the completion
of these improvements for a junction. The
younger branches, who already, and from their birth,
were well known to one another, were as eager as
their parents for a general union; and the very
amiable Miss Allen,<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
the most important personage in the juvenile group,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 197]</span>

conducted herself upon the disclosure of the marriage,
with a generous warmth of kindness that quickened the
new establishment. And her example would forcibly have
weighed with her deserving brother, Stephen Allen,<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
had such example been wanting; but he entertained so true
and affectionate a respect for Mr. Burney, that he
required neither duty nor influence to reconcile
him to the match.</p>

<p>The four daughters of Mr. Burney,&mdash;Esther,
Frances, Susan, and Charlotte,&mdash;were all earnest to
contribute their small mites to the happiness of one
of the most beloved of parents, by receiving, with
the most respectful alacrity, the lady on whom he had
cast his future hopes of regaining domestic comfort.</p>

<p>The Paris scheme for the two daughters, who were
to have followed the route of their sisters, long
remitted, from the fluctuating affairs and feelings
of Mr. Burney, was now finally abandoned. The
youngest daughter, Charlotte, was sent to a
school in Norfolk. The second, Frances, was the
only one of Mr. Burney’s family who never was
placed in any seminary, and never was put under

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 198]</span>

any governess or instructor whatsoever. Merely
and literally self-educated, her sole emulation for
improvement, and sole spur for exertion, were her
unbounded veneration for the character, and affection
for the person, of her father; who, nevertheless, had
not, at the time, a moment to spare for giving her
any personal lessons; or even for directing her
pursuits.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">POLAND STREET.</h3>

<p>The friends of Mr. Burney were not slack in
paying their devoirs to his new partner, whose
vivacious society, set off by far more than remains
of uncommon beauty, failed not to attract various
visitors to the house; and whose love, or rather
passion, for conversation and argument, were of that
gay and brilliant sort, that offers too much entertainment

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 199]</span>

to be ever left in the lurch for want of partakers.</p>

<p>Fortunate was it that such was the success of
her social spirit; which success was by no means
less flourishing, from her strong bent to displaying
the rites of hospitality. She must else have
lived the life of a recluse, Mr. Burney, during the
whole of the day, being devoted to his profession;
with the single exception of one poor hour of
repast, to re-fit him for every other of labour.</p>

<p>But the affection and pleasure with which, as</p>

<p class="center smaller">“The curfew toll’d the knell of parting day,”</p>

<p>he finished his toils, were so animated and so genuine,
that the sun, in the zenith of its splendour,
was never more ardently hailed, than the cool,
silent, evening star, whose soft glimmering light
restored him to the bosom of his family; not there
to murmur at his fatigues, lament his troubles, nor
recount his wearisome exertions; but to return,
with cheerful kindness, their tender greetings; to
enliven them with the news, the anecdotes, and
the rumours of the day; to make a spontaneous
<i lang="fr">catalogue raisonn&eacute;</i> of the people he had mixed
with or seen; and always to bring home any new

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 200]</span>

publication, political, poetical, or ethical, that was
making any noise in the world.</p>

<p>Amongst those of the old friends of Mr. Burney
who were the most eager to judge his second choice,
Roscius and Violetta, Mr. and Mrs. Garrick, seem
entitled to be first mentioned, from the pleasurable
remembrance of the delight bestowed upon the whole
family by their presence.</p>


<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">THE GREVILLES.</h3>

<p>And equally alert with the same congratulatory
courtesies, were his long and rootedly attached
friends, the Grevilles. Mr. Greville, curious to
behold the successor of her whom he had never
named, but as one of the prettiest women he had
ever seen, hastened to make his marriage visit on
the first morning that he heard of the bride’s
arrival in town: while of Mrs. Greville, the bridal
visit was arranged in such form, and with such
attention, as she thought would shew most consideration
to its object. She came on an appointed
day, that Mr. Burney might be certainly at home,
to present her to his wife; and she stayed to spend
the whole evening in Poland-street.</p>

<p>Her nearly peerless daughter, then in the first

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 201]</span>

radiance of her matchless bloom, who had been
lately married to Mr. Crewe, of Cheshire, with
the same zeal as her parents to manifest esteem
and affection for Mr. Burney, joined the party;
which consisted but of themselves, and of Mr.
Burney’s new and original young families.</p>

<p>Mrs. Greville, as was peculiarly in her power,
took the lead, and bore the burthen of the conversation;
which chiefly turned upon Sterne’s Sentimental
Journey, at that time the reigning reading
in vogue: but when the new Mrs. Burney recited,
with animated encomiums, various passages of
Sterne’s seducing sensibility, Mrs. Greville, shrugging
her shoulders, exclaimed: “A feeling heart
is certainly a right heart; nobody will contest that:
but when a man chooses to walk about the world
with a cambrick handkerchief always in his hand,
that he may always be ready to weep, either with
man or beast,&mdash;he only turns me sick.”</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">DR. HAWKESWORTH.</h3>

<p>With Dr. Hawkesworth Mr. Burney renewed an
acquaintance that he had begun at Wilbury House,
where he who could write the Adventurer, was not

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 202]</span>

likely to have wanted the public voice to awaken his
attention to a youth of such striking merit. Long
before that voice had sounded, Dr. Hawkesworth had
formed the most liberal and impartial opinion of the
young favourite of Mr. Greville. And when, upon
the occasion of the Doctor’s writing a hymn for the
children of the Foundling Hospital, Mr. Burney,
through the medium of Mr. Greville, was applied to
for setting it to music, the expressions, incidentally
dropt, of genius and judgment, in a letter of thanks
from Dr. Hawkesworth, would have been in perfect
accord with the attributes of the composer, had they
been bestowed after the History of Music had
stamped them as his due.</p>

<p>No opportunity was omitted by Mr. Burney for
cultivating the already established kindness of Mr.
Mason and of Dr. Armstrong.</p>

<p>Mr. Burney had frequent relations also, with that
scientific diver into natural history, and whatever
was ingenious, quaint, and little known, the Hon.
Daines Barrington.</p>

<p>Arthur Young, the afterwards famous agriculturist,
who had married a younger sister of Mr. Burney,
was, when in London, all but an inmate of the
Poland-street family; and the high, nay, at that

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 203]</span>

time, volatile spirits of Arthur Young, though
always kept within certain bounds by natively well-bred
manners, and instinctive powers of pleasing,
made him, to the younger group especially, the
most entertaining guest that enlivened the fire side.</p>

<p>Amongst those whom neither literature nor science,
but taste and choice, taught to signalise Mr.
Burney, foremost in the list of youthful beauty,
native talents, and animated softness, appeared Mrs.
Pleydell, daughter of Governor Holwell; so highly
celebrated for the dreadful sufferings, which he almost
miraculously survived to record, of incarceration, in
what was denominated the Black Hole of Calcutta.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pleydell, like the first, or Mrs. Linley
Sheridan, was encircled with charms that, but for
comparison with Mrs. Sheridan, might, at that time,
have been called unrivalled; charms at once so personal,
yet so mental, that they seemed entwined
together by a texture so fine of beauty and sensibility,
that her first glance was attraction, and her first
speech was captivation.</p>

<p>Nothing could surpass the sweetness with which
this lovely East Indian attached herself to Mr.
Burney; nor the delicacy of her arrangements for
appearing to receive favours in conferring them upon

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 204]</span>

his daughters; who were enamoured of her with an
ardour that, happily, he escaped; though his admiration
was lively and sincere.</p>

<p>This lady, in taking leave of Mr. Burney, upon
her return to India, presented to him a Chinese
painting on ivory, which she had inherited from her
father; and which he, Governor Holwell, estimated
as a sort of treasure. The following is the description
of it, drawn up by Mr. Burney, from the account
of Mrs. Pleydell.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“It is the representation of a music gallery over a triumphal
arch, through which the great Mogul passed at Agra, or Delhi,
before his fall. The procession consists of the Emperor, mounted
on an elephant, and accompanied by his wives, concubines, and
attendants; great officers of state, &amp;c., all exquisitely painted.
The heads of the females, Sir Joshua Reynolds and Sir Robert
Strange, to whom this painting was shewn, thought sufficiently
highly finished to be set in rings.”</p>
</blockquote>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">GEORGE COLMAN, THE ELDER.</h3>

<p>With that dramatic genius, man of wit, and elegant
scholar, George Colman the elder, Mr. Burney
had frequent and pleasant meetings at the mansion
of Roscius; for who, at that time, could know Mr.
Garrick, and be a stranger to Mr. Colman?<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 205]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">KIT SMART.</h3>

<p>Nor amongst the early friends of Mr. Burney
must ever be omitted that learned, ingenious, most
poetical, but most unfortunate son of Apollo, Kit
Smart; whom Mr. Burney always was glad to see,
and active to serve; though whatever belonged to
that hapless poet seemed to go in constant deterioration;
his affairs and his senses annually and palpably
darkening together; and nothing, unhappily,
flourishing in the attempts made for his relief, save
the friendship of Mr. Burney; in speaking of which
in a letter, Kit Smart touchingly says: “I bless
God for your good nature, which please to take for
a receipt.”</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">SIR ROBERT AND LADY STRANGE.</h3>

<p>The worthy, as well as eminent, Sir Robert
Strange, the first engraver of his day, with his
extraordinary wife and agreeable family, were, from
the time of the second marriage, amongst the most
familiar visitors of the Burney house.</p>

<p>The term extraordinary is not here applied to
Lady Strange to denote any singularity of action,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 206]</span>

conduct, or person; it is simply limited to her
conversational powers; which, for mother wit in
brilliancy of native ideas, and readiness of associating
analogies, placed her foremost in the rank of understanding
females, with whom Mr. Burney delighted
to reciprocate sportive, yet deeply reflective, discourse.
For though the education of Lady Strange
had not been cultivated by scholastic lore, she
might have said, with the famous Sarah, Duchess of
Marlborough, “My books are men, and I read
them very currently.” And in that instinctive
knowledge of human nature which penetration develops,
and observation turns to account, she was a
profound adept.</p>

<p>Yet, with these high-seasoned powers of exhilaration
for others, she was palpably far from happy
herself; and sometimes, when felicitated upon her
delightful gaiety, she would smile through a face of
woe, and, sorrowfully shaking her head, observe
how superficial was judgment upon the surface of
things, and how wide from each other might be
vivacity and happiness! the one springing only
from native animal spirits; the other being always
held in subjection by the occurrences that meet, or
that mar our feelings. And often, even in the midst

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 207]</span>

of the lively laugh that she had sent around her,
there would issue quite aloud, from the inmost
recesses of her breast, a sigh so deep it might rather
be called a groan.</p>

<p>Very early in life, she had given away her heart
and her hand without the sanction of a father
whom, while she disobeyed, she ardently loved.
And though she was always, and justly, satisfied
with her choice, and her deserving mate, she could
never so far subdue her retrospective sorrow, as to
regain that inward serenity of mind, that has its
source in reflections that have never been broken
by jarring interests and regrets.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">MR. CRISP.</h3>

<p>But the social enjoyment that came closest to
the bosom of Mr. Burney, and of all his race,
sprang spontaneously and unremittingly from the
delight of all their hearts, Mr. Crisp; who, from
his never abating love of music, of painting, of his
early friend, and of that friend’s progeny, never
failed to make his almost secret visit once a year
to town; though still, save for those few weeks,
he adhered, with inflexible perseverance, to his
retirement and his concealment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 208]</span></p>

<p>Yet whatever disinclination to general society
had been worked upon his temper by disappointment,
and fastened to his habits by ill health, the
last reproach that could be cast upon his conduct
was that of misanthropy; though upon his opinions
it might deserve, perhaps, to be the first.</p>

<p>He professed himself to be a complete disciple
of Swift, where that satirist, in defending his Yahoos,
in Gulliver’s Travels, avows that, dearly as
he loves John, William, and Thomas, when taken
individually, mankind, taken in the lump, he abhors
or despises.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Mr. Crisp had so pitying a humanity
for wrongs or misfortunes that were casual,
or that appeared to be incurred without vice or
crime, that, to serve a fellow-creature who called
for assistance, whether from his purse or his kindness,
was so almost involuntarily his common
practice, that it was performed as a thing of course,
without emotion or commentary.</p>

<p>Mr. Crisp, at this time, was the chief supporter
of Chesington Hall, which had now lost the long
dignity of its title, and was sunk into plain Chesington,
by the death of its last male descendant,
Christopher Hamilton; whose extravagances had

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 209]</span>

exhausted, and whose negligence had dilapidated
the old and venerable domain which, for centuries,
had belonged to his family.</p>

<p>The mansion, and the estate, fell, by law, into
the hands of Mrs. Sarah Hamilton, a maiden sister
of Christopher’s. But this helpless ancient lady
was rescued from the intricacies of so involved a
succession, by the skilful counsel of Mr. Crisp;
who proposed that she should have the capacious
old house parted nearly in halves, between herself
and an honest farmer, Master Woodhatch; who
hired of her, also, what little remained of grounds,
for a farm.</p>

<p>Yet, this done, Mrs. Sarah Hamilton was by no
means in a situation to reside in the share left to
her disposal: Mr. Crisp, therefore, suggested that
she should form a competent establishment for
receiving a certain number of boarders; and, to
encourage the project, entered his own name the
first upon her list; and secured to his own use a
favourite apartment, with a light and pleasant closet
at the end of a long corridor. This closet, some
years afterwards, he devoted to his friend Burney,
for whom, and for his pen, while he was writing
the History of Music, it was held sacred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 210]</span></p>

<p>And here, in this long-loved rural abode, during
the very few intervals that Mr. Burney could snatch
from the toils of his profession, and the cares of
his family, he had resorted in his widowhood, with
his delighted children, to enjoy the society of this
most valued and dearly-loved friend; whose open
arms, open countenance, faithful affection, and enchanting
converse, greeted the group with such expansive
glee, that here, in this long-loved rural abode,
the Burneys and happiness seemed to make a stand.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">INSTALLATION ODE.</h3>

<p>The first attempt of Mr. Burney, after his recent
marriage, to vary, though not to quit his professional
occupations, was seeking to set to music the Ode
written in the year 1769, by that most delicately
perfect, perhaps, of British poets, Gray, for the
installation of the Duke of Grafton as Chancellor
of the University of Cambridge.</p>

<p>The application to the Duke for this purpose
met with no opposition from his Grace; and the
earnest wish of Mr. Burney was to learn, and to
gratify, the taste of the exquisite poet whose verses
he was musically to harmonize, with regard to the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 211]</span>

mode of composition that would best accord with
the poet’s own lyrical ideas.</p>

<p>To this effect, he addressed himself both for
counsel and assistance to his early friend, Mr.
Mason; from whom he received a trusting and
obliging, but not very comfortable answer.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>Not a second did Mr. Burney lose in forwarding
every preparation for obviating any disgrace to his
melodious muse, Terpsichore, when the poetry of
the enchanting bard should come in contact with
her lyre. He formed upon a large scale a well
chosen band, vocal and instrumental, for the performance;
and he engaged, as leader of the orchestra,
the celebrated Giardini, who was the acknowledged
first violinist of Europe.</p>

<p>But, in the midst of these preliminary measures,
he was called upon, by an agent of the Duke, to
draw up an estimate of the expense.</p>

<p>This he did, and delivered, with the cheerfulest
confidence that his selection fully deserved its appointed
retribution, and was elegantly appropriate
to the dignity of its purpose.</p>

<p>Such, however, was not the opinion of the advisers
of the Duke; and Mr. Burney had the astonished

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 212]</span>

chagrin of a note to inform him, that the
estimate was so extravagant that it must be reduced
to at least one half.</p>

<p>Cruelly disappointed, and, indeed, offended, the
charge of every performer being merely what was
customary for professors of eminence, Mr. Burney
was wholly overset. His own musical fame might
be endangered, if his composition should be sung
and played by such a band as would accept of terms
so disadvantageous; and his sense of his reputation,
whether professional or moral, always took place of
his interest. He could not, therefore, hesitate to
resist so humiliating a proposition; and he wrote,
almost on the instant, a cold, though respectful
resignation of the office of composer of the Installation
Ode.</p>

<p>Not without extreme vexation did he take this
decided measure; and he was the more annoyed, as
it had been his intention to make use of so favourable
an opportunity for taking his degree of Doctor
of Music, at the University of Cambridge, for which
purpose he had composed an exercise. And, when
his disturbance at so unlooked for an extinction of
his original project was abated, he still resolved to
fulfil that part of his design.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 213]</span></p>

<p>He could not, however, while under the infliction
of so recent a rebuff, visit, in this secondary manner,
the spot he had thought destined for his greatest
professional elevation. He repaired, therefore, to
Oxford, where his academic exercise was performed
with singular applause, and where he took his degree
as Doctor in Music, in the year 1769.</p>

<p>And he then formed many connexions amongst
the professors and the learned belonging to that
University, that led him to revisit it with pleasure,
from new views and pursuits, in after-times.</p>

<p>So warmly was this academic exercise approved,
that it was called for at three successive annual
choral meetings at Oxford; at the second of which
the principal soprano part was sung by the celebrated
and most lovely Miss Linley, afterwards the St.
Cecilia of Sir Joshua Reynolds, and the wife of the
famous Mr. Sheridan; and sung with a sweetness
and pathos of voice and expression that, joined to
the beauty of her nearly celestial face, almost maddened
with admiring enthusiasm, not only the susceptible
young students, then in the first glow of
the dominion of the passions, but even the gravest
and most profound among the learned professors
of the University, in whom the “hey-day of the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 214]</span>

blood” might be presumed, long since, to have been
cooled.</p>

<p>From this period, in which the composer and
the songstress, in reflecting new credit, raised new
plaudits for each other, there arose between them a
reciprocation of goodwill and favour, that lasted unbroken,
till the retirement of that fairest of syrens
from the world.</p>

<p>The Oxonian new lay-dignitary, recruited in
health and spirits, from the flattering personal
consideration with which his academical degree had
been taken, gaily returned to town with his new
title of Doctor.</p>

<p>The following little paragraph is copied from a
memorandum book of that year.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I did not, for some time after the honour that had been
conferred on me at Oxford, display my title by altering the
plate on my street door; for which omission I was attacked by
Mr. Steel, author of an essay on the melody of speech. ‘Burney,’
says he, ‘why don’t you tip us the Doctor upon your
door?’ I replied, in provincial dialect, ‘I wants dacity!&mdash;’ ‘I’m
ashaeemed!’ ‘Pho, pho,’ says he, ‘you had better brazen it.’”</p>
</blockquote>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">HALLEY’S COMET.</h3>

<p>No production had as yet transpired publicly
from the pen of Dr. Burney, his new connexion

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 215]</span>

having induced him to consign every interval of
leisure to domestic and social circles, whether in
London, or at the dowry-house of Mrs. Burney, in
Lynn Regis, to which the joint families resorted
in the summer.</p>

<p>But when, from peculiar circumstances, Mrs.
Burney, and a part of the younger set, remained
for a season in Norfolk, the spirit of literary composition
resumed its sway; though not in the dignified
form in which, afterwards, it fixed its standard.</p>

<p>The long-predicted comet of the immortal Halley,
was to make its luminously-calculated appearance
this year, 1769; and the Doctor was ardently concurrent
with the watchers and awaiters of this prediction.</p>

<p>In the course of this new pursuit, and the researches
to which it led, Dr. Burney, no doubt,
dwelt even unusually upon the image and the recollection
of his Esther; who, with an avidity for
knowledge consonant to his own, had found time&mdash;made
it, rather&mdash;in the midst of her conjugal, her
maternal, and her domestic devoirs, to translate
from the French, the celebrated Letter of Astronomical
renown of Maupertuis; not with any prospect
of fame; her husband himself was not yet entered
upon its annals, nor emerged, save anonymously,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 216]</span>

from his timid obscurity: it was simply from a love
of improvement, and a delight in its acquirement.
To view with him the stars, and exchange with him
her rising associations of ideas, bounded all the
ambition of her exertions.</p>

<p>The recurrence to this manuscript translation, at
a moment when astronomy was the nearly universal
subject of discourse, was not likely to turn the Doctor
aside from this aerial direction of his thoughts;
and the little relic, of which even the hand-writing
could not but be affecting as well as dear to him,
was now read and re-read, till he considered it as
too valuable to be lost; and determined, after revising
and copying it, to send it to the press.</p>

<p>Whether any tender notion of first, though unsuspectedly,
appearing before the public by the side of
his Esther, stimulated the production of the Essay
that ensued from the revision of this letter; or whether
the stimulus of the subject itself led to the
publication of the letter, is uncertain; but that they
hung upon each other is not without interest, as
they unlocked, in concert, the gates through which
Doctor Burney first passed to that literary career
which, ere long, greeted his more courageous entrance
into a publicity that conducted him to celebrity;

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 217]</span>

for it was now that his first prose composition,
an Abridged History of Comets, was written; and
was printed in a pamphlet that included his Esther’s
translation of the Letter of Maupertuis.</p>

<p>This opening enterprize cannot but seem extraordinary,
the profession, education, and indispensable
business of the Doctor considered; and may bear
upon its face a character contradictory to what has
been said of his prudent resolve, to avoid any
attempt that might warp, or wean him from his own
settled occupation; till it is made known that this
essay was neither then, nor ever after avowed; nor
ever printed with his works.</p>

<p>It was the offspring of the moment, springing
from the subject of the day; and owing its birth,
there scarcely can be a doubt, to a fond, though
unacknowledged indulgence of tender recollections.</p>

<p>The title of the little treatise is, “An Essay
towards a History of Comets, previous to the re-appearance
of the Comet whose return had been
predicted by Edmund Halley.”</p>

<p>In a memorandum upon this subject, by Dr.
Burney, are these words:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The Countess of Pembroke, being reported to have studied
astronomy, and to have accustomed herself to telescopical observations,

<span class="pagenum-block">[Pg 218]</span>

I dedicated, anonymously, this essay to her ladyship,
who was much celebrated for her love of the arts and sciences,
and many other accomplishments. I had not the honour of
being known to her; and I am not certain whether she ever
heard by whom the pamphlet was written.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This Essay once composed and printed, the Doctor
consigned it to its fate, and thought of it no
more.</p>

<p>And the public, after the re-invisibility of the
meteor, and the declension of the topic, followed
the same course.</p>

<p>But not equally passive either with the humility of
the author, or with the indifferency of the readers,
were the consequences of this little work; which,
having been written wholly in moments stolen from
repose, though requiring researches and studies that
frequently kept him to his pen till four o’clock in
the morning, without exempting him from rising
at his common hour of seven; terminated in an
acute rheumatic fever, that confined him to his
bed, or his chamber, during twenty days.</p>

<p>This sharp infliction, however, though it ill recompensed

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 219]</span>

his ethereal flights, by no means checked
his literary ambition; and the ardour which was
cooled for gazing at the stars, soon seemed doubly
re-animated for the music of the spheres.</p>

<p>A wish, and a design, energetic, though vague,
of composing some considerable work on his own
art, had long roved in his thoughts, and flattered
his fancy: and he now began seriously to concentrate
his meditations, and arrange his schemes to
that single point. And the result of these cogitations,
when no longer left wild to desultory wanderings,
produced his enlightened and scientific
plan for a</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">GENERAL HISTORY OF MUSIC.</h3>

<p>This project was no sooner fixed than, transiently,
it appeared to him to be executed; so quick was
the rush upon his imagination of illuminating and
varying ideas; and so vast, so prolific, the material
which his immense collection of notes, abridgments,
and remarks, had amassed, that it seemed as if he
had merely to methodize his manuscripts, and entrust
them to a copyist, for completing his purpose.</p>

<p>But how wide from the rapidity of such incipient
perceptions were the views by which, progressively,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 220]</span>

they were superseded! Mightier and mightier
appeared the enterprize upon every new investigation;
more difficult, more laborious, and more
precarious in all its results: yet, also, as is usual
where Genius is coupled with Application, more
inviting, more inciting, and more alluring to the
hope of literary glory. ’Tis only where the springs
of Genius are clogged by “the heavy and retarding
weight” of Indolence; or where they are relaxed
by the nervous and trembling irresolutions of timidity,
that difficulties and dangers produce desertion.</p>

<p>Far, however, from the desired goal, as was the
measured distance of reality compared with the
visionary approaches of imagination, he had nothing
to lament from time thrown away by previous
labours lost: his long, multifarious, and curious,
though hitherto unpointed studies, all, ultimately,
turned to account; for he found that his chosen
subject involved, circuitously, almost every other.</p>

<p>Thus finally fixed to an enterprize which, in this
country, at least, was then new, he gave to it all
the undivided energies of his mind; and, urged by
the spur of ambition, and glowing with the vivacity
of hope, he determined to complete his materials
before he consigned them to their ultimate appropriations,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 221]</span>

by making a scientific musical tour through
France and Italy.</p>

<p>A letter,<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> of which a copy in his own hand-writing
remains, containing the opening view of his plan
and of his tour, addressed to the Reverend William
Mason, will shew how fully he was prepared for what
he engaged to perform, before he called for a subscription
to aid the publication of so expensive a work.</p>

<p>Through various of his friends amongst persons
in power, he procured recommendatory letters to
the several ambassadors and ministers from our
Court, who were stationed in the countries through
which he meant to travel.</p>

<p>And, through the yet more useful services of
persons of influence in letters and in the arts, he
obtained introductions, the most felicitous for his
enterprize, to those who, then, stood highest in
learning, in the sciences, and in literature.</p>

<p>None in this latter class so eminently advanced
his undertaking as Mr. Garrick; whose solicitations
in his favour were written with a warmth of
friendship, and an animation of genius, that carried
all before them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 222]</span></p>

<p>Here stops, for this period, the pen of the
memorialist.</p>

<p>From the month of June, 1770, to that of January,
1771, the life of Doctor Burney is narrated
by himself, in his “Tour to France and Italy.”</p>

<p>And few who have read, or who may read that
Tour, but will regret that the same pen, while in
its full fair vigour, had not drawn up what preceded,
and what will follow this epoch.</p>

<p>Such, however, not being the case, the memorialist
must resume her pen where that of Dr.
Burney, in his narrative, drops,&mdash;namely, upon his
regaining the British shore.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">QUEEN’S SQUARE.</h3>

<p>With all the soaring feelings of the first sun-beams
of hope that irradiate from a bright, though distant
glimpse of renown; untamed by difficulties, superior
to fatigue, and springing over the hydra-headed
monsters of impediment that every where jutted
forth their thwarting obstacles to his enterprize,
Dr. Burney came back to his country, his friends,
his business, and his pursuits, with the vigour of the
first youth in spirits, expectations, and activity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 223]</span></p>

<p>He was received by his longing family, enlivened
by the presence of Mr. Crisp, in a new house, purchased
in his absence by Mrs. Burney, at the upper
end of Queen-Square; which was then beautifully
open to a picturesque view of Hampstead and Highgate.
And no small recommendation to an enthusiastic
admirer of the British classics, was a circumstance
belonging to this property, of its having been
the dwelling of Alderman Barber, a friend of Dean
Swift; who might himself, therefore, be presumed
to have occasionally made its roof resound with the
convivial hilarity, which his strong wit, and stronger
humour, excited in every hearer; and which he
himself, however soberly holding back, enjoyed,
probably, in secret, with still more zest than he
inspired.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">CHESINGTON.</h3>

<p>This new possession, however, Dr. Burney could
as yet scarcely even view, from his eagerness to
bring out the journal of his tour. No sooner,
therefore, had he made arrangements for a prolongation
of leisure, that he hastened to Chesington
and to Mr. Crisp; where he exchanged his toils and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 224]</span>

labours for the highest delights of friendship; and a
seclusion the most absolute, from the noisy vicissitudes,
and unceasing, though often unmeaning persecution,
of trivial interruptions.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">THE MUSICAL TOURS.</h3>

<p>Here he prepared his French and Italian musical
tours for the press; omitting all that was miscellaneous
of observation or of anecdote, in deference to
the opinions of the Earl of Holdernesse, Mr. Mason,
and Mr. Garrick; who conjointly believed that
books of general travels were already so numerous,
and so spread, that their merits were over-looked
from their multiplicity.</p>

<p>If such, at that distant period, was the numerical
condemnation of this species of writing, which circumscribed
the first published tour of Dr. Burney
to its own professional subject, what would be now
the doom of the endless herd of tourists of all ranks,
qualifications, or deficiencies, who, in these later
times, have sent forth their divers effusions, without
sparing an idea, a recollection, or scarcely a dream,
to work their way in the world, through that general
master of the ceremonies, the press? whose portals,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 225]</span>

though guarded by two <i lang="fr">vis &agrave; vis</i> sentinels in eternal
hostility with each other, Fame and Disgrace, open
equally to publicity.</p>

<p>Mr. Crisp, nevertheless, saw in a totally different
light the miscellaneous part of the French and
Italian tours, and reprehended its rejection with the
high and spirited energy that always marked his
zeal, whether of censure or approbation, for whatever
affected the welfare of his favourites. But
Dr. Burney, having first consulted these celebrated
critics, who lived in the immediate world, was too
timid to resist their representations of the taste of
the moment; though in all that belonged not to the
modesty of apprehended partiality, he had the firmest
persuasion that the judgment of Mr. Crisp was
unrivalled.</p>

   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>


<p>The reception of this first acknowledged call for
public attention from Dr. Burney, was of the most
encouraging description; for though no renown
had yet been fastened upon his name, his acquirements
and his character, wherever he had been
known, had excited a general goodwill that prepared
the way to kindly approbation for this, and
indeed for every work that issued from his pen.</p>

<p>There was, in truth, something so spirited and
uncommon, yet of so antique a cast, in the travels,
or pilgrimage, that he had undertaken, in search of
materials for the history of his art, that curiosity was
awakened to the subject, and expectation was earnest
for its execution: and it was no sooner published,
than orders were received, by most of the great
booksellers of the day, for its purchase; and no
sooner read, than letters the most flattering, from
the deepest theorists of the science, and the best
judges of the practice of the art of music, reached
the favoured author; who was of too modest a character
to have been robbed of the pleasure of praise

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 227]</span>

by presumptuous anticipation; and of too natural a
one to lose any of its gratification by an apathetic
suppression of its welcome. And the effect, impulsive
and unsophisticated, of his success, was so ardent
an encouragement to his purpose, that while, mentally,
it animated his faculties to a yet more forcible
pursuit of their decided object, it darted him, corporeally,
into a travelling vehicle, which rapidly
wheeled him back again to Dover; where, with new
spirit and eagerness, he set sail upon a similar musical
tour in the Low Countries and in Germany, to
that which he had so lately accomplished in France
and Italy.</p>

<p>With respect to the French and Italian tour, the
restraint from all but its professional business, was
much lamented by the friends to whom the sacrifice
of the miscellaneous matter was communicated.</p>

<p>Upon the German tour not a comment will be
offered; it is before the public with an approvance
that has been stamped by the sanction of time. At
the period of its publication, Dr. Burney, somewhat
assured, though incapable of being rendered arrogant
by favour, ventured to listen only to the voice of his
first friend and monitor, who exhorted him to mingle
personal anecdotes with his musical information.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 228]</span></p>

<p>The consequence was such as his sage adviser
prognosticated; for both the applause and the sale
of this second and more diffuse social diary, greatly
surpassed those of its more technical predecessor.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the German tour, though thus successful
for narration to the public, terminated for
himself in sickness, fatigue, exorbitant expense, and
poignant bodily suffering.</p>

<p>While yet far away from his country, and equally
distant from accomplishing the purpose of his travels,
his solicitude not to leave it incomplete, joined to
his anxiety not to break his professional engagements,
led him to over-work and over-hurry his mental
powers, at the same time that he inflicted a similar
harass upon his corporeal strength. And while
thus doubly overwhelmed, he was assaulted, during
his precipitated return, by the rudest fierceness of
wintry elemental strife; through which, with bad
accommodations, and innumerable accidents, he
became a prey to the merciless pangs of the acutest
spasmodic rheumatism; which barely suffered him to
reach his home, ere, long and piteously, it confined
him, a tortured prisoner, to his bed.</p>

<p>Such was the check that almost instantly curbed,
though it could not subdue, the rising pleasure of

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 229]</span>

his hopes of entering upon a new species of existence,
that of an approved man of letters; for it was
on the bed of sickness, exchanging the light wines
of France, Italy, and Germany, for the black and
loathsome potions of the Apothecaries’ Hall; writhed
by darting stitches, and burning with fiery fever;
that he felt the full force of that sublunary equipoise,
that seems evermore to hang suspended over the
attainment of long-sought and uncommon felicity,
just as it is ripening to burst forth into enjoyment!</p>

<p>Again he retired to Chesington, to his care-healing,
heart-expanding, and head-informing Mr.
Crisp: and there, under the auspices of all that
could sooth or animate him; and nursed with incessant
assiduity by his fondly-attached wife and
daughters, he repaired his shattered frame; to fit it,
once again, for the exercise of those talents and
faculties, which illumine, in their expansive effects,
the whole race of mankind; long after the apparent
beings whence they have issued, seem faded, dissolved
away; leaving not, visibly, a track behind.</p>

<p>In Dr. Burney, disease was no sooner conquered,
than the vigour of his character brought back to
him pleasure and activity, through the spirited

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 230]</span>

wisdom with which he dismissed Regret for Anticipation.</p>

<p>There are few things in which his perfect good-humour was more playfully
demonstrated, than by the looks, arch yet reproachful, and piteous
though burlesque, with which he was wont to recount a most provoking
and painful little incident that occurred to him in his last voyage
home; but of which he was well aware that the relation must excite
irresistible risibility in even the most friendly of his auditors.</p>

<p>After travelling by day and by night to expedite
his return, over mountains, through marshes, by
cross-roads; on horseback, on mules, in carriages of
any and every sort that could but hurry him on, he
reached Calais in a December so dreadfully stormy,
that not a vessel of any kind could set sail for England.
Repeatedly he secured his hammock, and
went on board to take possession of it; but as
repeatedly was driven back by fresh gales, during
the space of nine fatiguing days and tempestuous
nights. And when, at last, the passage was effected,
so nearly annihilating had been his sufferings from sea-sickness,
that it was vainly he was told he might now,
at his pleasure, arise, go forth, and touch English

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 231]</span>

ground; he had neither strength nor courage to move,
and earnestly desired to be left awhile to himself.</p>

<p>Exhaustion, then, with tranquillity of mind, cast
him into a sound sleep.</p>

<p>From this repose, when, much refreshed, he awoke,
he called to the man who was in waiting, to help
him up, that he might get out of the ship.</p>

<p>“Get out of the ship, sir?” repeated the man.
“Good lauk! you’ll be drowned!”</p>

<p>“Drowned?&mdash;What’s to drown me? I want to
go ashore.”</p>

<p>“Ashore, sir?” again repeated the man; “why
you’re in the middle of the sea! There ar’nt a bit
of ground for your toe nail.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” cried the Doctor, starting
up; “the sea? did you not tell me we were safe in
at Dover?”</p>

<p>“O lauk! that’s two good hours ago, sir! I could
not get you up then, say what I would. You fell
downright asleep, like a top. And so I told them.
But that’s all one. You may go, or you may stay, as
you like; but them pilots never stops for nobody.”</p>

<p>Filled with alarm, the Doctor now rushed up to
the deck, where he had the dismay to discover that
he was half-way back to France.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 232]</span></p>

<p>And he was forced to land again at Calais; where
again, with the next mail, and a repetition of his
sea-sickness, he re-embarked for Dover.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On quitting Chesington, upon his recovery, for
re-entering his house in Queen-Square, the Doctor
compelled himself to abstain from his pen, his papers,
his new acquisitions in musical lore, and all that
demanded study for the subject that nearly engrossed
his thoughts, in order to consecrate the whole of his
time to his family and his affairs.</p>

<p>He renewed, therefore, his wonted diurnal course,
as if he had never diverged from it; and attended
his young pupils as if he had neither ability nor
taste for any superior occupation: and he neither
rested his body, nor liberated his ideas, till he had
re-instated himself in the professional mode of life,
upon which his substantial prosperity, and that of his
house, depended.</p>

<p>But, this accomplished, his innate propensities
sprang again into play, urging him to snatch at every
instant he could purloin, without essential mischief
from these sage regulations; with a redundance of
vivacity for new movement, new action, and elastic

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 233]</span>

procedure, scarcely conceivable to those who, balancing
their projects, their wishes, and their intentions,
by the opposing weights of time, of hazard, and of
trouble, undertake only what is obviously to their
advantage, or indisputably their duty. His Fancy was
his dictator; his Spirit was his spur; and whatever
the first started, the second pursued to the goal.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">ENGLISH CONSERVATORIO.</h3>

<p>But neither the pain of his illness, nor the pleasure
of his recovery, nor even the loved labours of
his History, offered sufficient occupation for the insatiate
activity of his mind. No sooner did he breathe
again the breath of health, resume his daily business,
and return to his nocturnal studies, than a
project occurred to him of a new undertaking, which
would have seemed to demand the whole time and
undivided attention of almost any other man.</p>

<p>This was nothing less than to establish in England
a seminary for the education of musical pupils of
both sexes, upon a plan of which the idea should
be borrowed, though the execution should almost
wholly be new-modelled, from the Conservatorios
of Naples and Vienna.</p>

<p>As disappointment blighted this scheme just as it

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 234]</span>

seemed maturing to fruition, it would be to little
purpose to enter minutely into its details: and yet,
as it is a striking feature of the fervour of Dr. Burney
for the advancement of his art, it is not its
failure, through the secret workings of undermining
prejudice, that ought to induce his biographer to
omit recounting so interesting an intention and
attempt: and the less, as a plan, in many respects
similar, has recently been put into execution, without
any reference to the original projector.</p>

<p>The motives that suggested this undertaking to
Dr. Burney, with the reasons by which they were
influenced and supported, were to this effect.</p>

<p>In England, where more splendid rewards await
the favourite votaries of musical excellence than in
any other spot on the globe, there was no establishment
of any sort for forming such artists as might
satisfy the real connoisseur in music; and save English
talent from the mortification, and the British
purse from the depredations, of seeking a constant
annual supply of genius and merit from foreign
shores.</p>

<p>An institution, therefore, of this character seemed
wanting to the state, for national economy; and to
the people, for national encouragement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 235]</span></p>

<p>Such was the enlarged view which Dr. Burney,
while yet in Italy, had taken of such a plan for his
own country.</p>

<p>The difficulty of collecting proper subjects to form
its members, caused great diversity of opinion and
of proposition amongst the advisers with whom
Dr. Burney consulted.</p>

<p>It was peculiarly necessary, that these young disciples
should be free from every sort of contamination,
mental or corporeal, upon entering this musical
asylum, that they might spread no dangerous
contagion of either sort; but be brought up to
the practice of the art, with all its delightful powers
of pleasing, chastened from their abuse.</p>

<p>With such a perspective, to take promiscuously
the children of the poor, merely where they had an
ear for music, or a voice for song, would be running
the risk of gathering together a mixed little multitude,
which, from intermingling inherent vulgarity,
hereditary diseases, or vicious propensities, with the
finer qualities requisite for admission, might render
the cultivation of their youthful talents, a danger&mdash;if
not a curse&mdash;to the country.</p>

<p>Yet, the length of time that might be required for
selecting little subjects, of this unadulterate description,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 236]</span>

from different quarters; with the next to impossibility
of tracing, with any certainty, what might
have been their real conduct in times past; or what
might be their principles to give any basis of security
for the time to come; caused a perplexity of the most
serious species: for should a single one of the tribe
go astray, the popular cry against teaching the arts
to the poor, would stamp the whole little community
with a stain indelible; and the institution
itself might be branded with infamy.</p>

<p>What, abstractedly, was desirable, was to try this
experiment upon youthful beings to whom the world
was utterly unknown; and who not only in innocence
had breathed their infantine lives, but in complete
and unsuspicious ignorance of evil.</p>

<p>Requisites so hard to obtain, and a dilemma so
intricate to unravel, led the Doctor to think of
the Foundling Hospital; in the neighbourhood
of which, in Queen-Square, stood his present
dwelling.</p>

<p>He communicated, therefore, his project, to Sir
Charles Whitworth, the governor of the hospital.</p>

<p>Sir Charles thought it proper, feasible, desirable,
and patriotic.</p>

<p>The Doctor, thus seconded, drew up a plan for

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 237]</span>

forming a Musical Conservatorio in the metropolis
of England, and in the bosom of the Foundling
Hospital.</p>

<p>The intention was to collect from the whole
little corps all who had musical ears, or tuneful
voices, to be brought up scientifically, as instrumental
or vocal performers.</p>

<p>Those of the group who gave no decided promise
of such qualifications, were to go on with their ordinary
education, and to abide by its ordinary result,
according to the original regulations of the charity.</p>

<p>A meeting of the governors and directors was
convened by their chief, Sir Charles Whitworth, for
announcing this scheme.</p>

<p>The plan was heard with general approbation;
but the discussions to which it gave rise were discursive
and perplexing.</p>

<p>It was objected, that music was an art of luxury,
by no means requisite to life, or accessary to morality.</p>

<p>These children were all meant to be educated as
plain, but essential members of the general community.
They were to be trained up to useful purposes,
with a singleness that would ward off all
ambition for what was higher; and teach them to

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 238]</span>

repay the benefit of their support by cheerful labour.
To stimulate them to superior views might mar the
religious object of the charity; which was to nullify
rather than extinguish, all disposition to pride, vice,
or voluptuousness; such as, probably, had demoralized
their culpable parents, and thrown these
deserted outcasts upon the mercy of the Foundling
Hospital.</p>

<p>This representation, the Doctor acknowledged,
would be unanswerable, if it were decided to be
right, and if it were judged to be possible, wholly to
extirpate the art of music in the British empire: or,
if the Foundling Hospital were to be considered as
a seminary; predestined to menial servitude; and as
the only institution of the country where the members
were to form a caste, from whose rules and
plodden ways no genius could ever emerge.</p>

<p>But such a fiat could never be issued by John
Bull; nor so flat a stamp be struck upon any portion
of his countrymen. John Bull was at once too
liberal and too proud, to seek to adopt the tame
ordinances of the immutable Hindoos; with whom
ages pass unmarked; generations unchanged; the
poor never richer; the simple never wiser; and with
whom, family by family, and trade by trade, begin,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 239]</span>

continue, and terminate, their monotonous existence,
by the same pre-determined course, and to the same
invariable destiny.</p>

<p>These children, the Doctor answered, are all
orphans; they are taken from no family, for by none
are they owned; they are drawn from no calling,
for to none are they specifically bred. They are
all brought up to menial offices, though they are all
instructed in reading and writing, and the females
in needle-work; but they are all, systematically and
indiscriminately, destined to be servants or apprentices,
at the age of fifteen; from which period, all
their hold upon the benevolent institution to which
they are indebted for their infantine rescue from
perishing cold and starving want, with their subsequent
maintenance and tuition, is rotatorily transferred
to new-born claimants; for the Hospital, then,
has fulfilled its engagements; and the children must
go forth to the world, whether to their benefit or
their disgrace.</p>

<p>Were it not better, then, when there are subjects
who are success-inviting, to bestow upon them professional
improvement, with virtuous education?
since, as long as operas, concerts, and theatres, are
licensed by government, musical performers, vocal

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 240]</span>

and instrumental, will inevitably be wanted, employed,
and remunerated. And every state is surely
best served, and the people of every country are
surely the most encouraged, when the nation suffices
for itself, and no foreign aid is necessarily called in,
to share either the fame or the emoluments of public
performances.</p>

<p>Stop, then; prohibit, proscribe&mdash;if it be possible,&mdash;all
taste for foreign refinements, and for the exquisite
finishing of foreign melody and harmony; or
establish a school on our own soil, in which, as in
Painting and in Sculpture, the foreign perfection of
arts may be taught, transplanted, and culled, till
they become indigenous.</p>

<p>And where, if not here, may subjects be found
on whom such a national trial may be made with
the least danger of injury? subjects who have been
brought up with a strictness of regular habits that
has warded them from all previous mischief; yet
who are too helpless and ignorant, as well as poor,
to be able to develop whether or not Nature, in
her secret workings, has kindled within their unconscious
bosoms, a spark, a single spark of harmonic
fire, that might light them, from being hewers of
wood, and brushers of spiders, to those regions

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 241]</span>

of vocal and instrumental excellence, that might
propitiate the project of drawing from our own culture
a school for music, of which the students, under
proper moral and religious tutelage, might, in time,
supersede the foreign auxiliaries by whom they are
now utterly extinguished.</p>

<p>The objectors were charged, also, to weigh well
that there was no law, or regulation, and no means
whatsoever, that could prevent any of this little association
from becoming singers and players, if they
had musical powers, and such should be their wish:
though, if self-thrown into that walk, singers and
players only at the lowest theatres, or at the tea and
cake public-gardens; or even in the streets, as fiddlers
of country dances, or as ballad squallers: in
which degraded exercise of their untaught endowments,
not only decent life must necessarily be
abandoned, but immorality, licentiousness, and riot,
must assimilate with, or, rather, form a prominent
part of their exhibitions and performances.</p>

<p>Here the discussion closed. The opponents were
silenced, if not convinced, and the trial of the project
was decreed.</p>

<p>The hardly-fought battle over, victory, waving
her gay banners, that wafted to the Doctor hopes of

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 242]</span>

future renown with present benediction, determined
him, for the moment, to relinquish even his history,
that he might devote every voluntary thought to
consolidating this scheme.</p>

<p>The primary object of his consideration, because
the most conscientious, was the preservation of the
morals, and fair conduct of the pupils. And here,
the exemplary character, and the purity of the principles
of Dr. Burney, would have shone forth to
national advantage, had the expected prosperity of
his design brought his meditated regulations into
practice.</p>

<p>Vain would it be to attempt, and useless, if not
vain, to describe his indignant consternation, when,
while in the full occupation of these arrangements,
a letter arrived to him from Sir Charles Whitworth,
to make known, with great regret, that the undertaking
was suddenly overthrown. The enemies to
the attempt, who had seemed quashed, had merely
lurked in ambush, to watch for an unsuspected moment
to convene a partial committee; in which they
voted out the scheme, as an innovation upon the
original purpose of the institution; and pleading,
also, an old act of parliament against its adoption,
they solemnly proscribed it for ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 243]</span></p>

<p>Yet a repeal of that act had been fully intended
before the plan, which, hitherto, had only been
agitating and negotiating, should have been put
into execution.</p>

<p>All of choice, however, and all of respect, that
remained for Dr. Burney, consisted in a personal
offer from Sir Charles Whitworth, to re-assemble
an opposing meeting amongst those friends who,
previously, had carried the day.</p>

<p>But happy as the Doctor would have been to
have gained, with the honour of general approbation,
a point he had elaborately studied to clear from
mystifying objections, and to render desirable, even
to patriotism; his pride was justly hurt by so abrupt
a defalcation; and he would neither with open hostility,
nor under any versatile contest, become the
founder, or chief, of so important an enterprize.</p>

<p>He gave up, therefore, the attempt, without
further struggle; simply recommending to the
mature reflections of the members of the last committee,
whether it were not more pious, as well as
more rational, to endeavour to ameliorate the character
and lives of practical musical noviciates, than to
behold the nation, in its highest classes, cherish the
art, follow it, embellish it with riches, and make it

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 244]</span>

fashion and pleasure&mdash;while, to train to that art,
with whatever precautions, its appropriate votaries
from the bosom of our own country, seemed to call
for opposition, and to deserve condemnation.</p>

<p>Thus died, in its birth, this interesting project,
which, but for this brief sketch, might never have
been known to have brightened the mind, as one of
the projects, or to have mortified it, as one of the
failures, of the active and useful life of Dr. Burney.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">HISTORY OF MUSIC.</h3>

<p>With a spirit greatly hurt through a lively sense
of injustice, and a laudable ambition surreptitiously
suppressed by misconception and prejudice, all that
was left for Dr. Burney in this ungracious business
was to lament loss of time, and waste of meditation.</p>

<p>Yet, the matter being without redress, save by
struggles which he thought beneath the fair design
of the enterprise, he combatted the intrusion of
availless discontent, by calling to his aid his well-experienced
antidote to inertness and discouragement,
a quickened application to changed, or renewed
pursuits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 245]</span></p>

<p>Again, therefore, he returned to his History of
Music; and now, indeed, he went to work with all
his might. The capacious table of his small but
commodious study, exhibited, in what he called his
chaos, the countless increasing stores of his materials.
Multitudinous, or, rather, innumerous blank
books, were severally adapted to concentrating some
peculiar portion of the work. Theory, practice;
music of the ancients; music in parts; national
music; lyric, church, theatrical, warlike music;
universal biography of composers and performers,
of patrons and of professors; and histories of
musical institutions, had all their destined blank
volumes.</p>

<p>And he opened a widely circulating correspondence,
foreign and domestic, with various musical
authors, composers, and students, whether professors
or dilettante.</p>

<p>And for all this mass of occupation, he neglected
no business, he omitted no devoir. The system by
which he obtained time that no one missed, yet that
gave to him lengthened life, independent of longevity
from years, was through the skill with which,
indefatigably, he profited from every fragment of
leisure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 246]</span></p>

<p>Every sick or failing pupil bestowed an hour upon
his pen. Every holiday for others, was a day of
double labour to his composition. Even illness took
activity only from his body, for his mind refused all
relaxation. He had constantly, when indisposed,
one of his daughters by his side, as an amanuensis;
and such was the vigour of his intellect, that even
when keeping his bed from acute rheumatism, spasmodic
pains, or lurking fever, he caught at every
little interval of ease to dictate some illustrative
reminiscence; to start some new ideas, or to generalize
some old ones; which never failed to while
away, partially at least, the pangs of disease, by
lessening their greatest torment to a character of
such energy, irreparable loss of time.</p>

<p>The plan, with proposals for printing the History
by subscription, was no sooner published, than the
most honourable lists of orders were sent to his
booksellers, from various elegant classic scholars, and
from all general patrons or lovers of new enterprises
and new works.</p>

<p>But that which deserves most remark, is a letter
from two eminent merchants of the city, Messieurs
Chandler and Davis, to acquaint the Doctor that a
gentleman, who wished to remain concealed, had

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 247]</span>

authorised them to desire, that Dr. Burney would not
suffer any failure in the subscription, should any occur,
to induce him to drop the work; as this gentleman
solemnly undertook to be himself responsible for every
set within the five hundred of the Doctor’s stipulation,
that should remain unsubscribed for on the ensuing
Christmas. And Messrs. Davis and Chandler were invested
with full powers, to give any security that might
be demanded for the fulfilment of this engagement.</p>

<p>Dr. Burney wrote his most grateful thanks to
this munificent protector of his project; but declined
all sort of tie upon the event. And the subscription
filled so voluntarily, that this generous unknown
was never called forth. Nor did he ever present
himself; nor was he ever discovered. But the incident
helped to keep warmly alive the predilection
which the Doctor had early imbibed, in favour of
the noble spirit of liberality of the city and the
citizens of his native land, for whatever seems to
have any claim to public character.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">MR. HUTTON.</h3>

<p>Another letter from another stranger, equally
animated by a sincere interest in the undertaking,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 248]</span>

though producing, for the moment, a sensation
as warm of resentment, as that just mentioned had
excited of gratitude, was next received by the
Doctor.</p>

<p>It was written with the most profuse praise of
the Musical Tours; but with a view to admonish
the Tourist to revise the account drawn up of the
expenses, the bad roads, the bad living, the bad
carriages, and other various faults and deficiencies
upon which the travels in Germany had expatiated:
all which this new correspondent was convinced
were related from misinformation, or misconception;
as he had himself visited the same spots without
witnessing any such imperfections. He conjured
the Doctor, therefore, to set right these statements
in his next edition; which single amendment would
render the journal of his Tour in Germany the most
delightful now in print: and, with wishes sincerely
fervent for all honour and all success to the business,
he signed himself, Dr. Burney’s true admirer,</p>

<p class="sig-right10 smcap">John Hutton,</p>
<p class="sig-right5"><i>Of Lindsey House, Chelsea</i>.</p>

<div class="topspace2"></div>

<p>Dr. Burney, who felt that his veracity had that
unsullied honour that, like the virtue of the wife of

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 249]</span>

C&aelig;sar, must not be suspected, read this letter with
the amazement, and answered it with the indignation,
of offended integrity. He could not, he said,
be the dupe of misrepresentation, for he had related
only what he had experienced. His narrative was
all personal, all individual; and he had documents,
through letters, bills, and witnesses in fellow-travellers,
and in friends or inhabitants of the several
places described, that could easily be produced to
verify his assertions: all which he was most able and
willing to call forth; not so much, perhaps, for the
satisfaction of Mr. Hutton, who so hastily had misjudged
him, as for his own; in certifying, upon
proof, how little he had deserved the mistrust of his
readers, as being capable of giving hearsay intelligence
to the public.</p>

<p>Mr. Hutton instantly, and in a tone of mingled
alarm and penitence, wrote a humble, yet energetic
apology for his letter; earnestly entreating the Doctor’s
pardon for his officious precipitancy; and
appealing to Dr. Hawkesworth, whom he called his
excellent friend, to intercede in his favour. He
took shame, he added, to himself, for not having
weighed the subject more chronologically before he
wrote his strictures; as he had now made out that

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 250]</span>

his hasty animadversion was the unreflecting result
of the different periods in which the Doctor and
himself had travelled; his own German visit having
taken place previously to the devastating war between
the King of Prussia and the Empress Queen, which
had since laid waste the whole country in which,
unhappily, it had been waged.</p>

<p>Dr. Burney accepted with pleasure this conceding
explanation. The good offices of Dr. Hawkesworth
were prompt to accelerate a reconciliation and an
interview; and Mr. Hutton, with even tears of
eager feelings to repair an unjust accusation, hastened
to Queen-Square. Dr. Burney, touched by
his ingenuous contrition, received him with open
arms. And, from that moment, he became one of
the Doctor’s most reverential and most ardent
admirers.</p>

<p>He made frequent visits to the house; conceived
the most friendly regard for the whole family; and
abruptly, and with great singularity, addressed a
letter, that was as original in ideas as in diction, to
one of the daughters,<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> with whom he demanded
permission of the Doctor to correspond. And in

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 251]</span>

a postscript, that was nearly as long as the epistle,
to obviate, probably, any ambiguous notions from
his zeal&mdash;though he was already a grey and wrinkled
old man&mdash;he acquainted his new young correspondent
that he had been married four-and-thirty years.</p>

<p>Mr. Hutton was one of the sect of the Moravians,
or Hurnhuters, and resided at Lindsey House,
Chelsea, as secretary to the united brethren. He
was author, also, of an Essay towards giving some
just ideas of the character of Count Zinzendorf, the
inventor and founder of the sect.</p>

<p>Mr. Hutton was a person of pleasing though
eccentric manners. His notions were uncommon;
his language was impressive, though quaint: his
imagination, notwithstanding his age, was playful,
nay, poetical. He considered all mankind as his
brethren, and himself, therefore, as every one’s
equal; alike in his readiness to serve them, and in
the frankness with which he demanded their services
in return.</p>

<p>His desire to make acquaintance, and to converse
with every body to whom any species of celebrity
was attached, was insatiable, and was dauntless.
He approached them without fear, and accosted
them without introduction. But the genuine kindness

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 252]</span>

of his smile made way for him wherever there
was heart and observation; and with such his encounter,
however uncouth, brought on, almost invariably,
a friendly intercourse.</p>

<p>Yet where, on the contrary, he met not with
those delicate developers and interpreters, heart
and observation, to instil into those he addressed
a persuasion of the benevolence of his intentions
in seeking fair and free fraternity with all his
fellow-creatures, he suffered not his failures to
dishearten him; for as he never meant, he never
took offence. And even when turned away from
with rudeness or alarm, as a man conceived to
be intrusive, impertinent, or suspicious, he would
neither be angry nor affronted; but, sorrowfully
shaking his head, would hope that some happy
accident would inspire them with softer feelings,
ere some bitter misfortune should retaliate their
unkindness.</p>

<p>The immediate, it might, perhaps, be said, the
instinctive cause of any rebuff that he met with in
public, namely, his extraordinary appearance, and
apparel, never seemed to occur to him; for as he
looked not at the finest garb of the wealthy or
modish with the smallest respect, he surmised not

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 253]</span>

that the shabbiness of his own could influence his
reception. By him, the tailor and the mantua-maker
were regarded merely as manufacturers of
decency, not of embellishment; and he had full as
much esteem for his own clumsy cobbler or second-hand
patching tailor, as the finest beau or belle of
Almack’s could have for their Parisian attirers.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, so coarse was the large, brown,
slouching surtout, which infolded his body; so
rough and blowsy was the old mop-like wig that
wrapt up his head; that, but for the perfectly serene
mildness of his features, and the venerability of his
hoary eye-brows, he might at all times have passed
for some constable, watchman, or policeman, who
had mistaken the day for the night, and was prowling
into the mansions of gentlemen, instead of public-houses,
to take a survey that all was in order.</p>

<p>That a man such as this, with every mark of a
nature the most unstained, and of a character the
most unsophisticated, could belong to a sect, which,
by all popular report at least, was stampt, at that
time, as dark and mystic; and as being wild and
strange in some of its doctrines even to absurdity;
must make every one who had witnessed the virtuous
tenor of the life of Mr. Hutton, and shared

in the inoffensive gaiety of his discourse, believe
the sect to have been basely calumniated; for not
a word was ever uttered by this singular being that
breathed not good will to all mankind; and not
an action is recorded, or known of him, that is
irresponsive of such universal benevolence.</p>

<p>Dr. Burney, now, without a single black-ball, was
elected a fellow of the Royal Society; of which
honour his first notice was received through the
amiable and zealous Miss Phipps,<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
who, knowing the day of election, had impatiently gathered the
tidings of its success from her brother, Sir Constantine
Phipps:<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
and before either the president, or the friend who had nominated
the Doctor for a candidate, could forward the news, she sportively
anticipated their intelligence, by sending to Queen-Square
a letter directed in large characters, “For
Dr. Burney, F. R. S.”<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">HISTORY OF MUSIC.</h3>

<p>From this period, the profession of Dr. Burney,
however highly he was raised in it, seemed but of
secondary consideration for him in the world; where,
now, the higher rank was assigned him of a man of
letters, from the general admiration accorded to his
Tours; of which the climax of honour was the
award of Dr. Johnson, that Dr. Burney was one
of the most agreeable writers of travels of the age.
And Baretti, to whom Dr. Johnson uttered this
praise, was commissioned to carry it to Dr. Burney;
who heard it with the highest gratification: though,
since his bereavement of his Esther, he had ceased
to follow up the intercourse he had so enthusiastically
begun. Participation there had been so animated,
that the charm of the connexion seemed,
for awhile, dissolved by its loss.</p>

<p>Letters now daily arrived from persons of celebrity,
with praises of the Tours, encouragement for
the History, or musical information for its advantage.
Mr. Mason, Mr. Harris of Salisbury, Dr.
Warton, Dr. Thomas Warton, Dr. Harrington, Mr.
Pennant, Montagu North, Mr. Bewley, Mr. Crisp,
and Mr. Garrick, all bestowed what Dr. Burney

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 256]</span>

sportively called sweet-scented bouquets on his
journals.</p>

<p>But amongst the many distinguished personages
who volunteered their services in honour of the
History of Music, the Doctor peculiarly valued the
name of Wellesley, Earl of Mornington, father of
the preserver, not alone of England, and of France,
but of Europe, at the awful crisis of general&mdash;almost
chaotic&mdash;danger.</p>

<p>This nobleman, the Earl of Mornington, with the
most liberal love of the arts, and most generous
admiration of their high professors, upon being
addressed by his friend, Mr. Rigby, in favour of
Dr. Burney’s pursuit, came forth, with a zeal the
most obliging, to aid the Doctor’s researches concerning
the antiquity of music in Ireland; and the
origin of the right of the Irish for bearing the harp
in their arms.</p>

<p>Some of his lordship’s letters will be found in
the correspondence, replete with information and
agreeability.</p>

<p>The Doctor held, also, a continental correspondence,
enlightening and flattering, with the Baron
d’Holbach, Diderot, the Abb&eacute; Morellet, M. Suard,
M. Monnet, and Jean Jacques Rousseau himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 257]</span></p>

<p>Of this last-named, and certainly most rare of his
epistolary contemporaries, Jean Jacques Rousseau,
the following note is copied from the Doctor’s
memorandums.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Five years after the representation of ‘The Cunning Man,’
when, in 1770, I had visited Rousseau at Paris, and entered into
correspondence with him, I sent him, in a parcel with other
books, a copy of ‘The Cunning Man,’ as it was performed and
printed in England to my translation of his ‘<cite>Devin du Village</cite>,’
and adjusted to his original music; and I received from him the
following answer.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">JOEL COLLIER.</h3>

<p>The quick-spreading favour with which the Tours
were received; the celebrity which they threw around
the name and existence of Dr. Burney; the associations
of rank, talents, literature, learning, and
fashionable coteries, to which they opened an entrance,
could not fail, ere long, to make their author
become an object of envy, since they raised him to
be one of admiration.</p>

<p>The character, conduct, and life of Dr. Burney
were now, therefore, no doubt, critically examined,
and morally sifted, by the jealous herd of contemporary
rivals, who had worked far longer, and far
more laboriously, through the mazes of science;
yet, working without similar genius, had failed of
rising to similar heights.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the immediate path in which Dr.

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 259]</span>

Burney flourished was so new, so untrodden, that
he displaced no competitor, he usurped no right of
others; and the world, unsought and uncanvassed,
was so instinctively on his side, that, for a considerable
time, his palpable pre-eminence seemed
as willingly accorded, as it was unequivocally acknowledged.</p>

<p>But the viper does not part with its venom from
keeping its body in ambush; and, before the History
came out, though long after the publication
of the Tours, a ludicrous parody of the latter was
sent forth into the world, under the name of Joel
Collier.</p>

<p>The Doctor, delicately anxious not to deserve
becoming an object for satire, was much hurt, on
its first appearance, by this burlesque production.
It attacked, indeed, little beyond the technical
phraseology of the Tours; the tourist himself was
evidently above the reach of such anonymous shafts.</p>

<p>It was generally supposed to be a <i lang="fr">jeu d’esprit</i>
of some enemy, to counteract his rapid progress in
public favour; and to undermine the promising
success of his great work.</p>

<p>But the Doctor himself did not give way to this
opinion: he had done nothing to incur enemies;

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 260]</span>

he had done much to conciliate friends; and, believing
in virtue because practising it, he knew not
how to conceive personal malice without personal
offence. He imagined it, therefore, the work of
some stranger, excited solely by the desire of
making money from his own risible ideas; without
caring whom they might harass, or how they
might irritate, provided, in the words of Rodrigo,
he “put money in his purse.”</p>

<p>The Doctor, however, as has been said, from the
unimpeachable goodness of his heart and character,
had the fair feelings of mankind in his favour. The
parody, therefore, though executed with burlesque
humour, whether urged or not by malevolence, was
never reprinted; and obtained but the laugh of a
moment, without making the shadow of an impression
to the disadvantage of the tourist.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">MR. TWINING.</h3>

<p>But the happiest produce to Dr. Burney of this
enterprise, and the dearest mede of his musical
labours, was the cordial connexion to which it led
with Mr. Twining, afterwards called Aristotle
Twining; which opened with an impulsive reciprocation

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 261]</span>

of liking, and ended in a friendship as
permanent as it was exhilarating.</p>

<p>Mr. Twining, urged by an early and intuitive
taste, equally deep and refined, for learning and
for letters, had begun life by desiring to make over
the very high emoluments of a lucrative business,
with its affluence and its cares, to a deserving
younger brother; while he himself should be quietly
settled, for the indulgence of his literary propensities,
in some retired and moderate living, at
a distance from the metropolis.</p>

<p>His father listened without disapprobation; and
at the vicarage of Colchester, Mr. Twining established
his clerical residence.</p>

<p>His acquaintance with Dr. Burney commenced
by a letter of singular merit, and of nearly incomparable
modesty. After revealing, in terms that
showed the most profound skill in musical science,
that he had himself not only studied and projected,
but, in various rough desultory sections, had actually
written certain portions of a History of Music,
he liberally acknowledged that he had found the
plan of the Doctor so eminently superior to his
own, and the means that had been taken for its
execution so far beyond his power of imitation,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 262]</span>

that he had come to a resolution of utterly renouncing
his design; of which not a vestige would
now remain that could reflect any pleasure upon
his lost time and pains, unless he might appease
his abortive attempt by presenting its fruits, with
the hope that they would not be found utterly
useless, to Dr. Burney.</p>

<p>So generous an offering could not fail of being
delightedly accepted; and the more eagerly, as the
whole style of the letter decidedly spoke its writer
to be a scholar, a wit, and a man of science.</p>

<p>Dr. Burney earnestly solicited to receive the
manuscript from Mr. Twining’s own hands: and
Mr. Twining, though with a timidity as rare in
accompanying so much merit as the merit itself,
complied with the request.</p>

<p>The pleasure of this first interview was an immediate
guarantee of the mental union to which it
gave rise. Every word that issued from Mr. Twining
confirmed the three high characters to which
his letter had raised expectation,&mdash;of a man of science,
a scholar, and a wit. Their taste in music, and their
selection of composers and compositions, were of the
same school; <em>i.e.</em> the modern and the Italian for
melody, and the German for harmony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 263]</span></p>

<p>Nor even here was bounded the chain by which
they became linked: their classical, literary, and
poetical pursuits, nay, even their fancies, glided so
instinctively into the same channel, that not a dissonant
idea ever rippled its current: and the animal
spirits of both partook of this general coincidence,
by running, playfully, whimsically, or ludicrously,
with equal concord of pleasantry, into similar inlets
of imagination.</p>

<p>The sense of this congeniality entertained by Dr.
Burney, will be best shewn by the insertion of some
biographical lines, taken from a chronological series
of events which he committed to paper, about this
time, for the amusement of Mrs. Burney.</p>

<p>The whole family participated in this delightful
accession to the comfort and happiness of its chief;
and, Mr. Crisp alone excepted, no one was received
by the Burnean tribe with such eagerness of welcome
as Mr. Twining.</p>

<p>A correspondence, literary, musical, and social,
took place between this gentleman and the Doctor,
when they separated, that made a principal pleasure,
almost an occupation, of their future lives. And
Dr. Burney thenceforward found in this willing
and accomplished fellow-labourer, a charm for his
work that made him hasten to it after his business
and cares, as to his most grateful recreation. While
Mr. Twining, exchanging a shyness that amounted
nearly to bashfulness, for a friendly trust that gave
free play to his sportive and original colloquial
powers, felt highly gratified to converse at his ease
with the man whose enterprise had filled him with
an admiration to which he had been almost bursting
to give some vent; but which he had so much
wanted courage to proclaim, that, as he afterwards
most humorously related, he had no sooner sent his
first letter for Dr. Burney to the post-office, than he
heartily hoped it might miscarry! and had hardly,
though by appointment, softly knocked at the door

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 265]</span>

of the Doctor, than he all but prayed that he should
not find him at home!</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">MR. BEWLEY.</h3>

<p>During a visit which, at this time, Dr. Burney
made to his old friends and connexions in Norfolk,
he spent a week or two with his truly-loved and
warmly-admired favourite, Mr. Bewley, of Massingham;
whose deep theoretical knowledge of the
science, and passion for the art of music, made,
now, a sojourn under his roof as useful to the work
of the Doctor, as, at all periods, it had been delightful
to his feelings.</p>

<p>Of this visit, which took place immediately after
one that had been fatiguingly irksome from stately
ceremony, he speaks, in his chronological rhymes,
in the following manner.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
<div class="verse">To Bewley retiring, in peace and in quiet,</div>
<div class="verse">Where our<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> welcome was hearty, and simple our diet;</div>
<div class="verse">Where reason and science all jargon disdain’d,</div>
<div class="verse">And humour and wit with philosophy reign’d&mdash;</div>

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 266]</span>

<div class="verse">Not a muse but was ready to answer his call;</div>
<div class="verse">By the virtues all cherish’d, the great and the small.</div>
<div class="verse">There Clio I court, to reveal every mystery</div>
<div class="verse">Of musical lore, with its practice and history.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Bewley, now, was the principal writer for
scientific articles in the Monthly Review, under the
editorship of Mr. Griffith. He was, also, in close
literary connexion with Dr. Priestley, Mr. Reid,
and Padre Beccaria; with whom to correspond he
had latterly dedicated some weeks exclusively to the
study of Italian, that he might answer the letters of
that celebrated man in his own language.</p>

<p>In company with this learned and dear friend,
Dr. Burney afterwards passed a week at Haughton
Hall, with the Earl of Orford, who invariably received
him with cordial pleasure; and who had the
manly understanding, combined with the classical
taste, always to welcome with marked distinction
the erudite philosopher of Massingham; though
that obscure philosopher was simply, in his profession,
a poor and hard-working country surgeon;
and though, in his habits, partly from frugal necessity,
and partly from negligent indifference, he was
the man the most miserably and meanly accoutred,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 267]</span>

and withal the most slovenly, of any who had ever
found his way into high society.</p>

<p>Lord Orford, with almost unexampled liberality,
was decidedly blind to all these exterior imperfections;
and only clear-sighted, for this gifted man
of mind, to the genius that, at times, in the arch
meaning of his smile, sparkled knowledge from his
eye, with an intelligent expression that brightened
into agreeability his whole queer face. And to
call into play those rugged features, beneath which
lurked the deepest information, and the most
enlightened powers of entertainment, was the
pleasure of the noble host; a distinction which
saved this unknown and humble country practitioner
from the stares, or the ridicule, of all new-arrived
guests; though secretly, no doubt, they marvelled
enough who he could be; and still more how he
came there.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">DR. HAWKESWORTH.</h3>

<p>At Haughton Hall these two friends found now
a large assembled party, of which the Earl of Sandwich,
then first lord of the Admiralty, was at the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 268]</span>

head. The whole conversation at the table turned
upon what then was the whole interest of the day,
the first voyage round the world of Captain Cooke,
which that great circumnavigator had just accomplished.
The Earl of Sandwich mentioned that
he had all the papers relating to the voyage in
his hands; with the circumnavigations preceding it
of Wallace and Byron; but that they were mere
rough draughts, quite unarranged for the public
eye; and that he was looking out for a proper person
to put them into order, and to re-write the
voyages.</p>

<p>Dr. Burney, ever eager upon any question of
literature, and ever foremost to serve a friend, ventured
to recommend Dr. Hawkesworth; who though,
from his wise and mild character, contented with his
lot, Dr. Burney knew to be neither rich enough for
retirement, nor employed enough to refuse any new
and honourable occupation. The <cite>Adventurer</cite> was
in every body’s library; but the author was less
generally known: yet the account now given of him
was so satisfactory to Lord Sandwich, that he entrusted
Dr. Burney with the commission of sending
Dr. Hawkesworth to the Admiralty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 269]</span></p>

<p>Most gladly this commission was executed. The
following is the first paragraph of Dr. Hawkesworth’s
answer to its communication:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Many, many thanks for your obliging favour, and the subject
of it. There is nothing about which I would so willingly be
employed as the work you mention. I would do my best to make
it another Anson’s Voyage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lord Sandwich, upon their meeting, was extremely
pleased with Dr. Hawkesworth, to whom
the manuscripts were immediately made over; and
who thus expressed his satisfaction in his next letter
to Dr. Burney.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I am now happy in telling you, that your labour of love is
not lost; that I have all the journals of the Dolphin, the Swallow,
and the Endeavour in my possession; that the government
will give me the cuts, and the property of the work will be my
own.</p>

<p>“Is it impossible I should give you my hand, and the thanks
of my heart, here? <em>i.e.</em> at Bromley.”</p>
</blockquote>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">CAPTAIN COOKE.</h3>

<p>Some time afterwards, Dr. Burney was invited to
Hinchinbroke, the seat of the Earl of Sandwich, to
meet Sir Joseph Banks, Dr. Solander, Dr. Hawkesworth,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 270]</span>

and the celebrated circumnavigator, Captain
Cooke himself.</p>

<p>It was the earnest request of James, the eldest
son of Dr. Burney, to be included in the approaching
second expedition of this great seaman; a request
which Lord Sandwich easily, and with pleasure,
accorded to Dr. Burney; and the young naval officer
was invited to Hinchinbroke, and presented to
his new commander, with a recommendation that he
should stand foremost on the list of promotion,
should any occasion of change occur during the
voyage.</p>

<p>The following note upon Captain Cooke, is copied
from a memorandum book of Dr. Burney’s.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“In February, I had the honour of receiving the illustrious
Captain Cooke to dine with me in Queen-Square, previously to
his second voyage round the world.</p>

<p>“Observing upon a table Bougainville’s <cite>Voyage autour du
Monde</cite>, he turned it over, and made some curious remarks on the
illiberal conduct of that circumnavigator towards himself, when
they met and crossed each other; which made me desirous to
know, in examining the chart of M. de Bougainville, the several
tracks of the two navigators; and exactly where they had crossed
or approached each other.</p>

<p>“Captain Cooke instantly took a pencil from his pocket-book,
and said he would trace the route; which he did in so clear

<span class="pagenum-block">[Pg 271]</span>

and scientific a manner, that I would not take fifty pounds for
the book. The pencil marks having been fixed by skim milk,
will always be visible.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This truly great man appeared to be full of sense
and thought; well-mannered, and perfectly unpretending;
but studiously wrapped up in his own
purposes and pursuits; and apparently under a
pressure of mental fatigue when called upon to
speak, or stimulated to deliberate, upon any other.</p>

<p>The opportunity which thus powerfully had been
prepared of promotion for the Doctor’s son, occurred
early in the voyage. Mr. Shanks, the
second lieutenant of the Discovery, was taken ill at
the Cape of Good Hope, and obliged to leave the
ship. “In his place,” Captain Cooke wrote to
Lord Sandwich, “I have appointed Mr. Burney,
whom I have found very deserving.”</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">DOCTOR GOLDSMITH.</h3>

<p>Dr. Goldsmith, now in the meridian of his late-earned,
but most deserved prosperity, was projecting
an English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences,
upon the model of the French Encyclop&aelig;dia. Sir
Joshua Reynolds was to take the department of

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 272]</span>

painting; Mr. Garrick, that of acting; Dr. Johnson,
that of ethics: and no other class was yet
nominated, when Dr. Burney was applied to for
that of music, through the medium of Mr. Garrick.</p>

<p>Justly gratified by a call to make one in so select
a band, Dr. Burney willingly assented; and immediately
drew up the article “Musician;” which he
read to Mr. Garrick; from whom it received warm
plaudits.</p>

<p>The satisfaction of Dr. Goldsmith in this acquisition
to his forces, will be seen by the ensuing
letter to Mr. Garrick; by whom it was enclosed,
with the following words, to Dr. Burney.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sig-right5">“<i>June 11, 1773.</i></p>

<p>The work, however, was never accomplished, and
its project sunk away to nothing; sincerely to the
regret of those who knew what might be expected
from that highly qualified writer, on a plan that
would eminently have brought forth all his various
talents; and which was conceived upon so grand a
scale, and was to be supported by such able coadjutors.
And deeply was public regret heightened that
it was by the hand of Death that this noble enterprise
was cut short; Death, which seemed to have
awaited the moment of the reversal of poverty and
hardship into prosperity and fame, for striking that
blow which, at an earlier period, might frequently,
for Dr. Goldsmith, have taken away a burthen
rather than a blessing. But such is the mysterious
construction of Life&mdash;that mere harbinger of Death!&mdash;always
obedient to the fatal knell he tolls, though

of Captain Cooke round the world, together
with the revisal and arrangement of the voyages
of Captain Wallace and Admiral Byron, was soon
overcast by sorrow, through circumstances as impossible
to have foreseen as not to lament.</p>

<p>Dr. Hawkesworth, though already in a delicate
state of health, was so highly animated by his election
to this office, and with the vast emolument
which, with scarcely any labour, promised to give
the dignity of ease and comfort to the rest of his
life; that he performed his task, and finished the
narratory compilation, with a rapidity of pleasure,
resulting from a promise of future independence,
that filled him with kind gratitude to Dr. Burney;
and seemed to open his heart, temper, and manners,
to the most cordial feelings of happiness.</p>

<p>But the greatness of his recompense for the smallness
of his trouble, immediately disposed all his
colleagues in the road of renown to censure; and
all his competitors in that of profit, to jealousy and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 275]</span>

ill-will. Unfortunately, in his Introduction to the
Voyages, he touched upon some controversial points
of religious persuasion, which proved a fatal opening
to malignity for the enemies of his success;
and other enemies, so upright was the man, it is
probable he had none. His reasoning here, unhappily,
was seized upon with avidity by his infuriated
enviers; and the six thousand pounds which
flowed into his coffers, brought six millions of pungent
stings to his peace, by arraigning his principles.</p>

<p>A war so ungenial to his placid nature, and
hitherto honoured life, breaking forth, with the
offensive enmity of assumed superior piety, in
calumnious assertions, that strove to blacken the
purity of his faith and doctrine; occurring at the
moment when he had thought all his worldly
cares blown away, to be succeeded by soft serenity
and easy affluence; made the attack so unexpected,
that its shock was enervating; and his wealth lost
its charms, from a trembling susceptibility that
detached him from every pleasure it could procure&mdash;save
that of a now baneful leisure for framing
answers to his traducers.</p>

<p>In his last visit, as it proved, to Queen-Square,
where he dined and spent the evening, Dr. Burney

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 276]</span>

was forcibly struck with concern at sight of the
evident, though uncomplaining invalid; so changed,
thin, and livid was his appearance.</p>

<p>He conversed freely upon the subject of his book,
and the abuse which it had heaped upon him, with
the Doctor; who strongly exhorted him to repel
such assaulters with the contempt that they deserved:
adding, “They are palpably the offsprings
of envy at your success. Were you to become a
bankrupt, they would all turn to panegyrists; but
now, there is hardly a needy man in the kingdom,
who has ever held a pen in his hand for a moment,
who, in pondering upon the six thousand pounds,
does not think he could have done the work better.”</p>

<p>Dr. Hawkesworth said that he had not yet made
any answer to the torrent of invective poured upon
him, except to Dalrymple, who had attacked him
by name; for a law-suit was then impending upon
Parkinson’s publication, and he would write nothing
that might seem meant to influence justice: but
when that law-suit, by whatever result, should be
decided, he would bring out a full and general
reply to all the invidious aspersions that so cruelly
and wantonly had been cast upon him, since the
publication of the Voyages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 277]</span></p>

<p>He then further, and confidentially, opened to
Dr. Burney upon his past life and situation: “Every
thing that I possess,” he cried, “I have earned by
the most elaborate industry, except this last six
thousand pounds! I had no education, and no
advantage but such as I sedulously worked to obtain
for myself; but I preserved my reputation and
my character as unblemished as my principles&mdash;till
this last year!”</p>

<p>Rallying a little then, from a depression which he
saw was becoming contagious, he generously changed
the subject to the History of Music; and begged
to be acquainted with its progress; and to learn
something of its method, manner, and meaning;
frankly avowing an utter ignorance of the capabilities,
or materials, that such a work demanded.</p>

<p>Dr. Burney read to him the dissertation,&mdash;then
but roughly sketched,&mdash;on the Music of the Ancients,
by which the History opens: and Dr. Hawkesworth,
confessing its subject to be wholly new to him,
warmly declared that he found its treatment extremely
entertaining, as well as instructive.</p>

<p>After a visit, long, and deeply interesting, he left
his friend very anxious about his health, and very
impatient for his promised pamphlet: but, while still

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 278]</span>

waiting, with strong solicitude, the appearance of
a vindication that might tranquillize the author’s
offended sensibility, the melancholy tidings arrived,
that a slow fever had robbed the invalid of sleep
and of appetite; and had so fastened upon his shattered
nerves, that, after lingering a week or two,
he fell a prey to incurable atrophy; and sunk to
his last earthly rest exactly a month after the visit
to Dr. Burney, the account of which has been
related.</p>

<p>Had the health of Dr. Hawkesworth been more
sound, he might have turned with cold disdain from
the outrages of mortified slanderers; or have scoffed
the impotent rage of combatants whom he had had
the ability to distance:&mdash;but, who shall venture to
say where begins, and where ends, the complicate
reciprocity of influence which involves the corporeal
with the intellectual part of our being? Dr.
Hawkesworth foresaw not the danger, to a constitution
already, and perhaps natively, fragile, of
yielding to the agitating effects of resentful vexation.
He brooded, therefore, unresistingly, over
the injustice of which he was the victim; instead
of struggling to master it by the only means
through which it is conquerable, namely, a calm

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 279]</span>

and determined silence, that would have committed
his justification to personal character;&mdash;a still, but
intrepid champion, against which falsehood never
ultimately prevails.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">KIT SMART.</h3>

<p>If thus untimely fell he who, of all the literary
associates of Dr. Burney, had attained the most prosperous
lot, who shall marvel that untimely should
be the fate of the most unfortunate of his Parnassian
friends, Christopher Smart? who, high in
literary genius, though in that alone, had a short
time previously, through turns of fortune, and concurrences
of events, wholly different in their course
from those which had undermined the vital powers
of Dr. Hawkesworth, paid as prematurely the solemn
debt relentlessly claimed by that dread accomptant-general,
Death!&mdash;of all alike the awful creditor!&mdash;and
paid it as helplessly the victim of substantial,
as Dr. Hawkesworth was that of shadowy, disappointment.</p>

<p>With failure at the root of every undertaking,
and abortion for the fruit of every hope, Kit Smart
finished his suffering existence in the King’s Bench

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 280]</span>

prison; where he owed to a small subscription, of
which Dr. Burney was at the head, a miserable
little pittance beyond the prison allowance; and
where he consumed away the blighted remnant of
his days, under the alternate pressure of partial
aberration of intellect, and bacchanalian forgetfulness
of misfortune.</p>

<p>His learning and talents, which frequently, in his
youth, had been crowned with classical laurels at the
University of Cambridge, had seemed to prognosticate
a far different result: but, through whatever
errors or irregularities such fair promises may have
been set aside, he, surely, must always call for
commiseration rather than censure, who has been
exposed, though but at intervals, to the unknown
disorders of wavering senses.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, whenever he was master of his
faculties, his piety, though rather fanatical than
rational, was truly sincere; and survived all his
calamities, whether mental or mundane.</p>

<p>He left behind him none to whom he was more
attached than Dr. Burney, who had been one of his
first favourite companions, and who remained his
last and most generous friend.</p>

<p>Alike through his malady and his distresses,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 281]</span>

the goodness of his heart, and his feeling for others,
were constantly predominant. In his latest letter to
Dr. Burney, which was written from the King’s
Bench prison, he passionately pleaded for a fellow-sufferer,
“whom I myself,” he impressively says,
“have already assisted according to my willing
poverty.”</p>

<p>Kit Smart is occasionally mentioned in Boswell’s
Life of Dr. Johnson, and with anecdotes given to
Mr. Boswell by Dr. Burney.</p>

<p>Mrs. Le Noir, the ingenious daughter of Mr.
Smart, is authoress of a pleasing production entitled
<cite>Village Manners</cite>, which she dedicated to Dr.
Burney.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">QUEEN-SQUARE.</h3>

<p>Dr. Burney now, in the intervals of his varied,
but never-ceasing occupations, gently, yet gaily,
enjoyed their fruits. All classes of authors offered
to him their services, or opened to him their stores.
The first musical performers then in vogue, Millico,
Giardini, Fischer, Cervetto, Crosdill, Barthelemon,
Dupont, Celestini, Parke, Corri, the blind
Mr. Stanley, La Baccelli, and that composer for the
heart in all its feelings, Sacchini; with various others,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 282]</span>

were always eager to accept his invitations, whether
for concerts, which occasionally he gave to his friends
and acquaintance; or to private meetings for the
regale of himself and family.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">OMIAH.</h3>

<p>But his most serious gratification of this period,
was that of receiving in safety and honour, James,
his eldest son, the lieutenant of Captain Cooke, on
the return from his second voyage round the world,
of that super-eminent navigator.</p>

<p>The Admiralty immediately confirmed the nomination
of Captain Cooke; and further, in consideration
of the character and services of the young naval
officer, promoted him to the rank of master and
commander.</p>

<p>The voyagers were accompanied back by Omiah,
a native of Ulitea, one of the Otaheitean islands.
Captain Burney, who had studied the language of
this stranger during the voyage home, and had
become his particular favourite, was anxious to
introduce the young South-Sea islander to his father
and family; who were at least equally eager to
behold a native of a country so remote, and of such
recent discovery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 283]</span></p>

<p>A time was quickly fixed for his dining and spending
the day in Queen-Square; whither he was
brought by Mr., afterwards Sir Joseph, Bankes, and
Dr. Solander; who presented him to Dr. Burney.</p>

<p>The behaviour of this young Otaheitean, whom it
would be an abuse of all the meaning annexed to
the word, to call a savage, was gentle, courteous,
easy, and natural; and shewed so much desire to
please, and so much willingness to be pleased himself,
that he astonished the whole party assembled
to receive him; particularly Sir Robert Strange and
Mr. Hayes; for he rather appeared capable to
bestow, than requiring to want, lessons of conduct
and etiquette in civilized life.</p>

<p>He had a good figure, was tall and well-made;
and though his complexion was swarthy and dingy,
it was by no means black; and though his features
partook far more of the African than of the European
cast, his eyes were lively and agreeable, and the
general expression of his face was good-humoured
and pleasing.</p>

<p>He was full dressed on this day, in the English
costume, having just come from the House of Lords,
whither he had been taken by Sir Joseph Bankes, to
see, rather than to hear, for he could not understand

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 284]</span>

it, the King deliver his speech from the throne. He
had also been admitted to a private audience of his
Majesty, whom he had much entertained.</p>

<p>A bright Manchester velvet suit of clothes, lined
with white satin, in which he was attired, sat upon
him with as much negligence of his finery, as if it
had been his customary dress from adolescence.</p>

<p>But the perfect ease with which he wore and managed
a sword, which he had had the honour to receive
from the king, and which he had that day put on for
the first time, in order to go to the House of Lords,
had very much struck, Sir Joseph said, every man
by whom it had been observed; since, by almost
every one, the first essay of that accoutrement had
been accompanied with an awkwardness and inconvenience
ludicrously risible; which this adroit Otaheitean
had marvellously escaped.</p>

<p>Captain Burney had acquired enough of the Otaheitean
language to be the ready interpreter of
Omiah with others, and to keep him alive and in
spirits himself, by conversing with him in his own
dialect. Omiah understood a little English, when
addressed in it slowly and distinctly; but could
speak it as yet very ill; and with the peculiarity,
whether adopted from the idiom of his own tongue,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 285]</span>

or from the apprehension of not being clearly comprehended,
of uttering first affirmatively, and next
negatively, all the little sentences that he attempted
to pronounce.</p>

<p>Thus, when asked how he did, he answered
“Ver well; not ver ill.” Or how he liked any
thing, “Ver nice; not ver nasty.” Or what he
thought of such a one, “Ver dood; not ver bad.”</p>

<p>On being presented by Captain Burney to the
several branches of the family, when he came to this
memorialist, who, from a bad cold, was enveloped
in muslin wrappings, he inquired into the cause of
her peculiar attire; and, upon hearing that she was
indisposed, he looked at her for a moment with concern,
and then, recovering to a cheering nod, said,
“Ver well to-morrow morrow?”</p>

<p>There had been much variation, though no serious
dissension, among the circumnavigators during the
voyage, upon the manner of naming this stranger.
Captain Burney joined those officers who called him
Omai; but Omiah was more general; and Omy was
more common still. The sailors, however, who
brought him over, disdaining to scan the nicety of
these three modes of pronunciation, all, to a man,
left each of them unattempted and undiscussed, and,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 286]</span>

by universal, though ridiculous agreement, gave him
no other appellation than that of Jack.</p>

<p>His after visits to the house of Dr. Burney were
frequent, and evidently very agreeable to him. He
was sure of a kind reception from all the family,
and he was sincerely attached to Captain Burney;
who was glad to continue with him the study of the
Otaheitean language, preparatory to accompanying
Captain Cooke in his third circumnavigation, when
Omiah was to be restored to his own island and
friends.</p>

<p>In the currency of this intercourse, remarks were
incessantly excited, upon the powers of nature unassisted
by art, compared with those of art unassisted
by nature; and of the equal necessity of some species
of innate aptness, in civilized as well as in savage life,
for obtaining success in personal acquirements.</p>

<p>The diserters on the instruction of youth were
just then peculiarly occupied by the letters of Lord
Chesterfield; and Mr. Stanhope, their object, was
placed continually in a parallel line with Omiah:
the first, beginning his education at a great public
school; taught from an infant all attainable improvements;
introduced, while yet a youth, at foreign
courts; and brought forward into high life with all

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 287]</span>

the favour that care, expense, information, and
refinement could furnish; proved, with all these
benefits, a heavy, ungainly, unpleasing character:
while the second, with neither rank nor wealth, even
in his own remote island; and with no tutor but
nature; changing, in full manhood, his way of life,
his dress, his country, and his friends; appeared,
through a natural facility of observation, not alone
unlike a savage, but with the air of a person who
had devoted his youth to the practice of those
graces, which the most elaborately accomplished of
noblemen had vainly endeavoured to make the
ornament of his son.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">MR. CRISP.</h3>

<p>Another severe illness broke into the ease, the
prosperity, and the muse of Dr. Burney, and drove
him, perforce, to sojourn for some weeks at Chesington,
with his friend, Mr. Crisp; whose character,
in the biographical and chronological series of events,
is thus forcibly, though briefly, sketched.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse-first-line">“To Crisp I repair’d&mdash;that best guide of my youth,</div>
    <div class="verse">Whose decisions all flow from the fountain of truth;</div>

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 288]</span>

    <div class="verse">Whose oracular counsels seem always excited</div>

   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>To this inestimable Mentor, and to Chesington, that
sanctuary of literature and of friendship, Dr. Burney,
even in his highest health, would uncompelled
have resorted, had Fortune, as kind to him in her
free gifts as Nature, left his residence to his choice.</p>

<p>But choice has little to do with deciding the
abode of the man who has no patrimony, yet who
wishes to save his progeny from the same hereditary
dearth: the Doctor, therefore, though it was to the
spot of his preference that he was chased, could not,
now, make it that of his enjoyment: he could only,
and hardly, work at the recovery of his strength;
and, that regained, tear himself away from this
invaluable friend, and loved retreat, to the stationary
post of his toils, the metropolis.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">ST. MARTIN’S STREET.</h3>

<p>His house in Queen-Square had been relinquished
from difficulties respecting its title; and Mrs.

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 289]</span>

Burney, assiduously and skilfully, purchased and
prepared another, during his confinement, that was
situated in St. Martin’s-street, Leicester-fields.</p>

<p>If the house in Queen-Square had owed a fanciful
part of its value to the belief that, formerly, in his
visits to Alderman Barber, it had been inhabited
occasionally by Dean Swift, how much higher a
local claim, was vested in imagination, for a mansion
that had decidedly been the dwelling of the immortal
Sir Isaac Newton!</p>

<p>Dr. Burney entered it with reverence, as may be
gathered from the following lines in his doggrel
chronology.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
<div class="verse-first-line">“This house, where great Newton once deign’d to reside,</div>
<div class="verse">Who of England, and all Human Nature the pride,</div>
<div class="verse">Sparks of light, like Prometheus, from Heaven purloin’d,</div>
<div class="verse">Which in bright emanations flash’d full on mankind.”</div>
   </div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>This change of position from Queen-Square to
St. Martin’s-street, required all that it could bestow
of convenience to business, of facilitating fashionable
and literary intercourse, of approximation to travelling
foreigners of distinction, and of vicinity to the
Opera House; to somewhat counter-balance its unpleasant
site, its confined air, and its shabby immediate

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 290]</span>

neighbourhood; after the beautiful prospect
which the Doctor had quitted of the hills, ever
verdant and smiling, of Hampstead and Highgate;
which, at that period, in unobstructed view, had
faced his dwelling in Queen-Square.</p>

<p>St. Martin’s-street, though not narrow, except at
its entrance from Leicester-square, was dirty, ill
built, and vulgarly peopled.</p>

<p>The house itself was well-constructed, sufficiently
large for the family, and, which now began to demand
nearly equal accommodation, for the books
of the Doctor. The observatory of Sir Isaac Newton,
which surmounted its roof, over-looked all London
and its environs. It still remained in the same
simple state in which it had been left by Sir Isaac;
namely, encompassed completely by windows of small
old-fashioned panes of glass, so crowded as to leave
no exclusion of the glazier, save what was seized for
a small chimney and fire-place, and a cupboard,
probably for instruments. Another cupboard was
borrowed from the little landing-place for coals.</p>

<p>The first act of Dr. Burney, after taking possession
of this house, was to repair, at a considerable
expense, the observatory of the astronomical chief
of nations: and he had the enthusiasm, soon afterwards,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 291]</span>

of nearly re-constructing it a second time,
in consequence of the fearful hurricane of 1778, by
which its glass sides were utterly demolished; and
its leaden roof, in a whirl of fighting winds, was
swept wholly away.</p>

<p>Dr. Burney, who was as elevated in spirit as he
was limited in means, for being to all the arts, and
all the artists, a patron, preferred any self-denial to
suffering such a demolition. He would have thought
himself a ruthless Goth, had he permitted the
<i lang="la">sanctum sanctorum</i> of the developer of the skies
in their embodied movements, to have been scattered
to nonentity through his neglect or parsimony; and
sought for, thenceforward, in vain, by posterity.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Amongst the earliest hailers of this removal, stood
forth the worthy and original Mr. Hutton, who was
charmed to visit his enthusiastically esteemed new
friend in the house of the great Newton; in which
he flattered himself with retaining a faint remembrance
that he had been noticed, when a boy, by the
niece of that most stupendous of human geniuses.</p>

<p>In shaking hands around with the family upon
this occasion, Mr. Hutton related that he had just

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 292]</span>

come from the apartment of M. de Solgas, sub-preceptor
to his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales;<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
in which he had had the high honour of being permitted
to discourse with his Majesty; whom he had
found the best of men, as well as the best of Kings;
for, in talking over the letters of Lord Chesterfield,
and his Lordship’s doctrines, and subtle definitions
of simulation and dissimulation, his Majesty said,
“It is very deep, and may be it is very clever; but
for me, I like more straight-forward work.”</p>

<p>This tribute to the honour of simple truth excited
a general plaudit. Mr. Hutton then, with a smile
of benevolent pleasure, said that the subject had
been changed, by Mr. Smelt, from Lord Chesterfield’s
letters to Dr. Burney’s Tours, which had been
highly commended: “And then I,” added the good
old man, “could speak my notions, and my knowledge,
too, of my excellent friend the tourist, as
well as of his writings; and so, openly and plainly,
as one honest man should talk to another, I said it
outright to my sovereign lord the King&mdash;who is as
honest a man himself as any in his own three kingdoms.
God bless him!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 293]</span></p>

<p>All the party, greatly pleased, smiled concurrence;
and Mrs. Burney said that the Doctor was
very happy to have had a friend to speak of him so
favourably before the King.</p>

<p>“Madam,” cried the good man, with warmth,
“I will speak of him before my God! And that is
doing much more.”</p>

<p>The Stranges, who lived in the immediate neighbourhood
of St. Martin’s-street, were speedy welcomers
to the new dwelling; where heartily they
were welcomed.</p>

<p>The Doctor’s worthy and attached old friend,
Mr. Hayes, rejoiced in this near approach to his
habitation, which was in James-street, Westminster;
though the fast advancing ravages and debilities of
time and infirmities, soon bereaved him of all other
advantage from the approximation, than that which
he could court to his own house.</p>

<p>Mr. Twining, when in town, which was only for
a week or two every year, loved not to pass even a
day without bestowing a few minutes of it upon a
house at which he was always hailed with delight.</p>

<p>But Mr. Crisp, though unalterably he maintained
that first place in the heart of Dr. Burney, to which
priority of every species entitled him, had become

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 294]</span>

subject to such frequent fits of the gout, that to London
he was almost lost: he dreaded sleeping even a
night from Chesington, which now was his nearly
unbroken residence.</p>

<p>The learned and venerable Mr. Latrobe, and his
two sons, each of them men of genius, though of
different characters, were frequent in their visits,
and amongst the Doctor’s warmest admirers; and,
in the study of the German language and literature,
amongst his most useful friends.</p>

<p>The elegant translator of Tasso, Mr. Hoole, and
his erudite and poetical son, the Rev. Samuel
Hoole,<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> to form whose characters worth and
modesty went hand in hand, were often of the
social circle.</p>

<p>The Doctor’s two literary Italian friends, Martinelli
and Baretti, were occasional visitors; and by
the rapidity of their elocution, the exuberance of
their gestures, and the distortion of their features,
upon even the most trivial contradiction, always gave
to the Doctor a divertingly national reminiscence of
the Italian, or Volcanic, portion of his tours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 295]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Nollekens, the eminent sculptor, was one of
the travelled acquaintances of Dr. Burney, with
whom he had frequently assorted while in Italy; and
with whom now, and through life, he kept up the
connexion then formed.</p>

<p>Nollekens was one of those who shewed, in the
most distinct point of view, the possible division of
partial from general talent. He was uncultivated
and under-bred; his conversation was without mark;
his sentiments were common; and his language was
even laughably vulgar; yet his works belong to an
art of transcendant sublimity, and are beautiful with
elegance and taste.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">MR. BRUCE.</h3>

<p>But more peculiarly this new residence was opened
by the distinction of a new acquaintance, who was
then as much the immediate lion of the day, as had
been the last new acquaintance, Omiah, who had
closed the annals of the residence in Queen-Square.</p>

<p>This personage was no other than the famous
Mr. Bruce, who was just returned to England, after
having been wandering, and thought to be lost,
during four years, in the deserts and sands of the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 296]</span>

hitherto European-untrodden territory of Africa, in
search of the source, or sources, of the Nile.</p>

<p>The narrations, and even the sight of Mr. Bruce,
were at this time vehemently sought, not only by
all London, but, as far as written intercourse could
be stretched, by all Europe.</p>

<p>The tales spread far and wide, first of his extraordinary
disappearance from the world, and next of
his unexpected re-appearance in the heart of Africa,
were so full of variety, as well as of wonder, that
they raised equal curiosity in the most refined and
the most uncultivated of his contemporaries.</p>

<p>Amongst these multifarious rumours, there was
one that aroused in Dr. Burney a more eager desire
to see and converse with this eminent traveller, than
was felt even by the most ardent of the inquirers
who were pressing upon him, in successive throngs,
for intelligence.</p>

<p>The report here alluded to, asserted, that Mr.
Bruce had discovered, and personally visited, the
long-famed city of Thebes; and had found it such
as Herodotus had described: and that he had
entered and examined its celebrated temple; and
had made, and brought home, a drawing of the
Theban harp, as beautiful in its execution as in its

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 297]</span>

form, though copied from a model of at least three
thousand years old.</p>

<p>Mr. Bruce had brought, also, from Egypt, a
drawing of an Abyssinian lyre in present use.</p>

<p>The assiduity of Dr. Burney in devising means of
introduction to whosoever could increase, or ameliorate,
the materials of his history, was not here put
to any proof. Mr. Bruce had been an early friend of
Mrs. Strange, and of her brother, Mr. Lumisden;
and that zealous lady immediately arranged a meeting
between the parties at her own house.</p>

<p>As this celebrated narrator made the opening of
his career as an author, in the History of Music of
Dr. Burney; to the &eacute;clat of which, on its first appearance,
he not slightly contributed, by bestowing
upon it the two admirable original drawings above-mentioned,
with a letter historically descriptive of
their authenticity; some account of him seems naturally
to belong to this place: and the Editor is
persuaded, that two or three genuine, though juvenile
letters which she wrote, at the time, to Mr.
Crisp, may be more amusing to the reader, from
their natural flow of youthful spirits, in describing
the manners and conversation of this extraordinary
wanderer, than any more steady recollections that

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 298]</span>

could at present be offered from the same pen. And,
led by this persuasion, she here copies a part of her
early and confidential correspondence with her father’s,
her family’s, and her own first friend.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>“Well, now then, my dear Daddy,<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
I have got courage to obey your call for more! more! more!
without fear of fatiguing you, for I have seen the
great man-mountain, Mr. Bruce; and have been in

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 299]</span>

his high and mighty presence three times; as I
shall proceed to tell you in due form and order,
and with all the detail you demand.</p>



<h4 class="nobreak">“MEETING THE FIRST</h4>

<p>took place at the tea-table, at Mrs. Strange, to
which my mother, by appointment, had introduced
her Lynn friends, Mr. and Mrs. Turner, who were
extremely curious to see Mr. Bruce. My dear father
was to have escorted us; but that provoking mar-plot,
commonly called Business, came, as usual, in
the way, and he could only join us afterwards.</p>

<p>“The man-mountain, and Mr. and Mrs. Turner,
were already arrived; and no one else was invited,
or, at least, permitted to enter.</p>

<p>“Mr. Bruce, as we found, when he arose&mdash;which
he was too stately to do at once&mdash;was placed on the
largest easy chair; but which his vast person covered
so completely, back and arms, as well as seat, that
he seemed to have been merely placed on a stool;
and one was tempted to wonder who had ventured
to accommodate him so slightly. He is the tallest
man you ever saw in your life&mdash;at least, <i lang="la">gratis</i>.
However, he has a very good figure, and is rather
handsome; so that there is nothing alarming, or

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 300]</span>

uncomely, or, I was going to say, ungenial&mdash;but I
don’t think that is the word I mean&mdash;in his immense
and authoritative form.</p>

<p>“My mother was introduced to him, and placed
by his side; but, having made her a cold, though
civilish bow, he took no further notice even of her
being in the room. I, as usual, glided out of the
way, and got next to Miss Strange, who is agreeable
and sensible: and who, seeing me, I suppose, very
curious upon the subject, gave me a good deal of
information about Man-Mountain.</p>

<p>“As he is warmly attached to Mrs. Strange and
her family, he spends all his disengaged evenings
at their house, where, when they are alone, he is
not only chatty and easy, but full of comic and dry
humour; though, if any company enters, he sternly,
or gloatingly, Miss Strange says, shuts up his mouth,
and utters not a word&mdash;except, perhaps, to her parrot;
which, I believe, is a present from himself.
Certainly he does not appear more elevated above
the common race in his size, than in his ideas of
his own consequence. Indeed, I strongly surmise,
that he is not always without some idea how
easy it would be to him&mdash;and perhaps how pleasant&mdash;in
case any one should dare to offend him,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 301]</span>

to toss a whole company of such pigmies as the
rest of mankind must seem to him, pell-mell down
stairs,&mdash;if not out of the window.</p>

<p>“There is some excuse, nevertheless, for this
proud shyness, because he is persuaded that nobody
comes near him but either to stare at him as a curiosity,
or to pick his brains for their own purposes:
for, when he has deigned to behave to people as if
he considered himself as their fellow-creature, every
word that has been drawn from him has been printed
in some newspaper or magazine; which, as he intends
to publish his travels himself, is abominably
provoking; and seems to have made him suspicious
of some dark design, or some invidious trick, when
any body says to him ‘How do you do, Sir?’ or,
‘Pray, Sir, what’s o’clock?’</p>

<p>“And, after all, if his nature in itself is as imperious
as his person and air are domineering, it is
hardly fair to expect that having lived so long
among savages should have softened his manners.</p>

<p>“Well, when all the placements, and so forth,
were over, we went to tea. There’s an event for
you, my dear Sir!</p>

<p>“There was, however, no conversation. Mr.
Bruce’s grand air, gigantic height, and forbidding

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 302]</span>

brow, awed every body into silence, except Mrs.
Strange; who, with all her wit and powers, found
it heavy work to talk without reply.</p>

<p>“But Mr. Turner suffered the most. He is, you
know, a very jocular man, and cannot bear to lose
his laugh and his <i lang="fr">bon mot</i>. Yet he durst not
venture at either; though he is so accustomed to
indulge in both, and very successfully, in the country,
that he seemed in blank dismay at finding himself
kept in such complete subordination by the
fearful magnitude of Mr. Bruce, joined to the
terror of his looks.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Turner, still less at her ease, because still
less used to the company of strangers, attempted not
to obtain any sort of notice. Yet, being gay in her
nature, she, too, did not much like being placed so
totally in the back ground. But she was so much
impressed by the stateliness of this renowned traveller,
that I really believe she sat saying her prayers
half the evening, that she might get away from the
apartment without some affront.</p>

<p>“Pray have you happened to read a paragraph in
the newspapers, importing that Mr. Bruce was dying,
or dead? My father, who had seen him alive and
well the day before it appeared, cut it out, and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 303]</span>

wafered it upon a sheet of paper, and sent it to him
without comment.</p>

<p>“My mother now inquired of Mr. Bruce whether
he had seen it?</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ answered he, coolly; ‘but they are welcome
to say what they please of me. I read my
death with great composure.’ Then, condescending
to turn to me,&mdash;though only, I doubt not, to turn
away from my elders,&mdash;he added: ‘Were you not
sorry, Miss Burney, to hear that I was dead?’</p>

<p>“Finding him thus address himself, and rather
courteously, for he really smiled, to so small a personage
as your very obedient servant, Mr. Turner,
reviving, gathered courage to open his mouth, and,
with a put-on air of easy jocularity, ventured to
exclaim, with a laugh, ‘Well, sir, as times go, I
think, when they killed you, it is very well they said
no harm of you.’</p>

<p>“‘I know of no reason they had!’ replied Mr.
Bruce, in so loud a tone, and with an air of such
infinite haughtiness, that poor Mr. Turner, thus
repulsed in his first attempt, never dared to again
open his lips.</p>

<p>“Soon afterwards, a servant came into the room,
with General Melville’s compliments, and he begged

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 304]</span>

to know of Mrs. Strange whether it was true that
Mr. Bruce was so dangerously ill.</p>

<p>“‘Yes!’ cried he, bluffly; ‘tell the General I
am dead.’</p>

<p>“‘Ay, poor soul! poor mon!’ cried Mrs. Strange,
‘I dare say he has been vexed enough to hear such
a thing! Poor honest mon! I dare be sworn he
never wronged or deceived a human being in all his
life.’</p>

<p>“‘Will you, faith?’ cried Mr. Bruce: ‘Will you
be sworn to that? It’s more than I would dare to
be for any man alive! Do you really think he has
risen to the rank of General, with so little trouble?’</p>

<p>“‘Troth, yes,’ she answered; ‘you men, you
know, never deceive men! you have too much honour
for that. And as to us women,&mdash;ah, troth!
the best among you canno’ deceive me! for whenever
you say pretty things to me, I make it a rule
to believe them all to be true: so the prettier the
better!’</p>

<p>“Miss Bell Strange, the youngest daughter, a
very sensible little girl, about ten years old, now
brought him his tea. He took it, in chucking her
under the chin; which was evidently very annoying
to her, as a little womanly consciousness is just stealing

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 305]</span>

upon her childhood: but, not heeding that, he
again turned to me, and said, ‘Do you know, Miss
Burney, that I intend to run away with Bell? We
are going to Scotland together. She won’t let me
rest till I take her to Gretna Green.’</p>

<p>“‘La! how can you say so, sir,?’ cried Bell,
colouring, and much fidgetted. ‘Pray, Ma’am, don’t
believe it!’</p>

<p>“‘Why, how now, Bell?&mdash;What! won’t you
go?’</p>

<p>“‘No, sir, I won’t!’ answered Bell, very demurely.</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ cried he, with a scoffing smile, and
rising, ‘this is the first lady that ever refused me.’</p>

<p>“He then inquired of Mrs. Strange whether she
had heard any thing lately of Lord R., of whom
they joined in drawing a most odious character;
especially for his avarice. And when they had
finished the portrait, Mr. Bruce, advancing his
great figure towards me, exclaimed, ‘And yet this
man is my rival!’</p>

<p>“‘Really?’ cried I, hardly knowing what he
expected I should say, but afraid to affront him by
a second total silence.</p>

<p>“‘O, it’s true!’ returned he, in a tone that implied

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 306]</span>

<em>though not credible</em>; ‘Is it not true, Mrs. Strange,
that he is my rival?’</p>

<p>“‘Troth, they say so,’ answered she, calmly.</p>

<p>“‘I wonder he should dare!’ cried my mother.
‘I wonder he should not apprehend that the long
residence in Egypt of Mr. Bruce, had made him so
well acquainted with magic, that’&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘O,’ interrupted Mr. Bruce, coolly, ‘I shall not
poison him. But I may bribe his servant to tie a
rope across his staircase, on some dark night, and
then, as I dare say the miserly wretch never allows
himself a candle to go up and down stairs, he may
get a tumble, and break his neck.’</p>

<p>“This idea set him into a fit of laughter quite
merry to behold; and as I caught, from surprise,
a little of its infection, he was again pleased to
address himself to me, and to make inquiry whether
I was musical; expressing his hopes that he should
hear me play, when Mrs. Strange fulfilled her
engagement of bringing him to our house; adding,
that he had a passionate love of music.</p>

<p>“‘I was once,’ said Mrs. Strange, ‘with a young
lady, a friend of mine, when she was at a concert
for the first time she ever heard any music, except
nursery lullabys, or street holla-balloos, or perhaps

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 307]</span>

a tune on a fiddle by some poor blind urchin. And
the music was very pretty, and quite tender; and
she liked it so well, it almost made her swoon; and
she could no’ draw her breath; and she thrilled all
over; and sat sighing and groaning, and groaning
and sighing, with over-much delight, till, at last, she
burst into a fit of tears, and sobbed out, ‘I can’t
help it!’</p>

<p>“‘There’s a woman,’ said Mr. Bruce, with some
emotion, ‘who could never make a man unhappy!
Her soul must be all harmony.’</p>

<p>“My dear father now arrived; and he and Mr.
Bruce talked apart for the rest of the evening, upon
the harp and the letter.</p>

<p>“But when the carriage was announced, imagine
my surprise to see this majestic personage take it
into his fancy to address something to me almost in
a whisper! bending down, with no small difficulty,
his head to a level with mine. What it was I could
not hear. Though perhaps ’twas some Abyssinian
compliment that I could not understand! It’s flattery,
however, could not have done me much mischief,
after Miss Strange’s information, that, when
he is not disposed to be social with the company at
large, he always singles out for notice the youngest

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 308]</span>

female present&mdash;except, indeed, a dog, a bird, a cat,
or a squirrel, be happily at hand.</p>

<p>“As I had no ‘retort courteous’ ready, he grandly
re-erected himself to the fullest extent of his commanding
height; setting me down, I doubt not, in
his black book, for a tasteless imbecile. Every body,
however, as all his motions engage all attention,
looked so curious, that my only gratitude for his
condescension, was heartily wishing him at one of
the mouths of his own famous Nile.</p>

<p>“Will you not wish me there too, my dearest Mr.
Crisp, for this long detail, without one word of said
Nile, and its endless sources? or of Thebes and its
hundred gates? or of the two harps of harps that
are to decorate the History of Music? But nothing
of all this occurred; except it might be in his private
confab. with my father.</p>

<p>“You demanded, however, an account of his
manner, his air, and his discourse; and what sort
of mode, or fashion, he had brought over from
Ethiopia.</p>

<p>“And here, so please you, all that is at your
feet.</p>

<p>“I have only to add, that his smile, though
rare, is really graceful and engaging. But his

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 309]</span>

laugh, when his dignity is off its guard, and some
sportive or active mischief comes across his ideas&mdash;such
as the image of his miserly rival, Lord R.,
dangling from a treacherous rope on his own staircase;
or tumbling headlong down,&mdash;is a chuckle
of delight that shines his face of a bright scarlet,
and shakes his whole vast frame with a boyish
ecstacy.</p>

<p>“But I forgot to mention, that while Mr. Bruce
was philandering with little Miss Bell Strange, who,
with comic childish dignity, resented his assumed
success, he said he believed he had discovered the
reason of her shyness; ‘Somebody has told you,
I suppose, Bell, that when I am taken with a hungry
fit in my rambles, I make nothing of seizing on a
young bullock, and tying him by the horns to a tree,
while I cut myself off a raw beef-steak, and regale
myself upon it with its own cold gravy? according to
my custom in Abyssinia? Perhaps, Bell, you may
think a young heifer might do as well? and are afraid
you might serve my turn, when my appetite is
rather keen, yourself? Eh, Bell?’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“You have accepted Meeting the First with so

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 310]</span>

much indulgence, my dear Mr. Crisp, that I am all
alertness for presenting you with</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">MEETING THE SECOND,</h4>

<p>which took place not long after the First, already
recorded in these my elaborate annals.</p>

<p>“My father invited Mr. Twining, the great
Grecian, to said meeting. What a contrast did he
form with Mr. Bruce, the great Ethiopian! I have
already described Mr. Twining to you, though very
inadequately; for he is so full of merits, it is not
easy to find proper phrases for him. There is only
our dear Mr. Crisp whom we like and love half as
well.</p>

<p>“Mr. Twining, with all his excellencies,&mdash;and
he is reckoned one of the first scholars living; and is
now engaged in translating Aristotle,&mdash;is as modest
and unassuming as Mr. Bruce is high and pompous.
He came very early, frankly owning, with a sort of
piteous shrug, that he really had not bronze to present
himself when the party should be assembled,
before so eminent, but tremendous a man, as report
painted Mr. Bruce; though he was extremely gratified
to nestle himself into a corner, as a private
spectator.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 311]</span></p>

<p>“Mrs. Strange, with her daughter, arrived next;
and told us that his Abyssinian Majesty, as she calls
Mr. Bruce, had dined at General Melville’s, but
would get away as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>“We waited tea, in our old-fashioned manner, a
full hour; but no Mr. Bruce. So then we&mdash;or
rather I&mdash;made it. And we all united to drink it.
There, Sir; there’s another event for you!</p>

<p>“Mr. Twining entreated that we might no longer
postpone the concert, and was leading the way to
the library, where it was to be held; but just then,
a thundering rap at the door raised our expectations,
and stopt our steps;&mdash;and Mr. Bruce was
announced.</p>

<p>“He entered the room with the state and dignity
of a tragedy giant.</p>

<p>“We soon found that something had displeased
him, and that he was very much out of humour:
and when Mrs. Strange inquired after General
Melville, he answered her, with a face all made up
of formidable frowns, that the General had invited a
most stupid set of people to meet him. He had
evidently left the party with disgust. Perhaps they
had asked him whether there were any real men and
women in Abyssinia, or only bullocks and heifers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 312]</span></p>

<p>“He took his tea in stern silence, without deigning
to again open his lips, till it was to demand a
private conference with my father. They then went
together to the study,&mdash;erst Sir Isaac Newton’s&mdash;which
is within the library.</p>

<p>“In passing through the latter, they encountered
Mr. Twining, who would hastily have shrunk back;
but my father immediately, and with distinction to
Mr. Twining, performed the ceremony of introduction.
Mr. Bruce gravely bowed, and went on; and
he was then shut up with my father at least an hour,
in full discussion upon the Theban harp, and the
letter for the history.</p>

<p>“Mr. Twining returned, softly and on tiptoe, to
the drawing room; and advancing to Mrs. Strange
and my mother, with uplifted hands and eyes, exclaimed,
‘This is the most awful man I ever saw!&mdash;I
never felt so little in all my life!’</p>

<p>“‘Well, troth,’ said Mrs. Strange, ‘never mind!
If you were six feet high he would overlook you;
and he can do no more now.’</p>

<p>“Mr. Twining then, to recover breath he said,
sat down, but declared he was in fear of his life;
‘for if Mr. Bruce,’ he cried, ‘should come in hastily,
and, not perceiving such a pitiful Lilliputian,
should take the chair to be empty&mdash;it will soon be

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 313]</span>

over with me! I shall be jammed in a moment&mdash;while
he will think he is only dropping down upon
a cushion!’</p>

<p>“As the study confab. seemed to menace duration,
Mr. Twining petitioned Mr. Burney to go to
the piano-forte; where he fired away in a voluntary
with all the astonishing powers of his execution, and
all the vigour of his genius.</p>

<p>“He might well be animated by such an auditor
as Mr. Twining, who cannot be a deeper Grecian
than he is a refined musician. How happy is my
dear father that the three best, and dearest, and
wisest, of his friends, should be three of the most
scientific judges of his own art,&mdash;Mr. Twining, Mr.
Bewley, and Mr. Crisp.</p>

<p>“Dear me! how came that last name into my
head? I beg your pardon a thousand times. It
was quite by accident. A mere slip of the pen.</p>

<p>“Mr. Twining, astonished, delighted, uttered
the warmest praises, with all his heart; but that
fervent effusion over, dropped his voice into its
lowest key, to add, with a look full of arch pleasantry,
‘Now, is not this better than being tall?’</p>

<p>“My poor sister, Burney, was not quite well,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 314]</span>

and had a hurt on one of her fingers. But though
she could not exert herself to play a solo, she consented
to take her part in the noble duet for the
piano-forte of M&uuml;thel; and she was no sooner
seated, than Mr. Bruce re-appeared in our horizon.</p>

<p>“You well know that enchanting composition,
which never has been more perfectly executed.</p>

<p>“Mr. Twining was enraptured; Mrs. Strange
listened in silent wonder and pleasure; and Mr.
Bruce himself was drawn into a charmed attention.
His air lost its fierceness; his features relaxed into
smiles; and good humour and complacency turned
pride, sternness, and displeasure, out of his phiz.</p>

<p>“I begin now to think I have perhaps been too
criticising upon poor man-mountain; and that, when
he is not in the way of provocation to his vanity,
he may be an amiable, as well as an agreeable man.
But I suppose his giant-form, which makes every
thing around him seem diminutive, has given him
a notion that he was born to lord it over the rest of
mankind; which, peradventure, seems to him a mere
huddle of Lilliputians, as unfit to cope with him,
mentally, in discourse, as corporeally in a wrestling
match.</p>

<p>“Mr. Twining had been invited to supper; and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 315]</span>

as it now grew very late, my mother made the invitation
general; which, to our great surprise, Mr.
Bruce was the first to accept. Who, then, could
start any objection?</p>

<p>“So softened had he been by the music, that he
was become all courtesy. Nobody else was listened
to, or looked at; and as he scarcely ever deigns to
look at any body himself, he is a primary object for
peering at.</p>

<p>“The conversation turned upon disorders of the
senses; for Mrs. Strange has a female friend who
is seized with them, from time to time, as other
people might be seized with an ague. She had
been on a visit at the house of Mrs. Strange, the
day before, where she had met Mr. Bruce. When it
was perceived that a fit of the disorder was coming
on, Miss Strange took her home; for which extraordinary
courage Mr. Bruce greatly blamed her.</p>

<p>“‘How,’ said he, ‘could you be sure of your
life for a single moment? Suppose she had thought
proper to run a pair of scissors into your eyes? Or
had taken a fancy to cutting off one of your ears?’</p>

<p>“Miss Strange replied, that she never feared,
for she always knew how to manage her.</p>

<p>“Mr. Bruce then inquired what had been the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 316]</span>

first symptom she had shewn of the return of her
malady?</p>

<p>“Mrs. Strange answered, that the beginning of
her wandering that evening, had been by abruptly
coming up to her, and asking her whether she could
make faces?</p>

<p>“‘I wish,’ said Mr. Bruce, ‘she had asked me!
I believe I could have satisfied her pretty well that
way!’</p>

<p>“‘O, she had a great desire to speak to you,
sir,’ said Miss Strange, ‘she told me she had a great
deal to say to you.’</p>

<p>“‘If,’ said Mr. Bruce, ‘she had come up to me,
without any preface, and made faces at me,&mdash;I confess
I should have been rather surprised!’</p>

<p>“‘Troth,’ said Mrs. Strange, ‘if we are not
upon our guard, we are all of us mad when we are
contradicted! for we are all of us so witty, in our
own ideas, that we think every mon out of his head
that does not see with our eyes. But when I tried to
hold her, poor little soul, from running into the
street, while we were waiting for the coach, she
gave me such a violent scratch on the arm, that
I piteously called out for help. See! here’s the
mark.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 317]</span></p>

<p>“‘Did she fetch blood,’ cried Mr. Bruce, in a
tone of alarm; ‘if she did, you will surely go out of
your own senses before a fortnight will be over!
You may depend upon that! If you are bit by a
wild cat, you will undoubtedly become crazy; and
how much more if you are scratched by a crack-brained
woman? I would advise you to go forthwith
to the sea, and be well dipped. I assure you fairly
I would not be in your situation.’</p>

<p>“I thought this so shocking, that I felt a serious
impulse to expostulate with his giantship upon it
myself, and <em>almost</em> the courage; but, whether perceiving
my horror, or only imagining it, I cannot
tell; he deigned to turn his magnificent countenance
full upon me, to display that he was laughing. And
he afterwards added, that he knew there was nothing
in this case that was any way dangerous; though
how he obtained the knowledge he kept to himself.</p>

<p>“My mother then expressed her hopes that the
poor lady might not, meanwhile, be removed to a
private asylum; as in these repositories, the patients
were said to be goaded on to become worse, every
time a friend or a physician was expected to visit
them; purposely to lengthen the poor sufferer’s
detention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 318]</span></p>

<p>“‘Indeed!’ cried Mr. Bruce, knitting his brows,
‘why this is very bad encouragement to going out
of one’s senses!’</p>

<p>“The rest of the conversation was wholly upon
this subject; and so, as I know you hate the horrors,
I must bid good night to Meeting the Second with
his Abyssinian Majesty.</p>

<p>“The <i lang="fr">t&ecirc;te &agrave; t&ecirc;te</i> in the study had been entirely
upon the two drawings; and in settling the points
upon which Mr. Bruce had best expatiate in his
descriptive and historical epistle.</p>

<p>“My father has great satisfaction in being the
first to bring forth the drawings and the writings of
this far-famed traveller before the public. The only
bad thing was, that it kept him away from us
all supper-time, to put down the communications
he had received, and the hints he wished to give for
more.</p>

<p>“Mr. Twining, too, wrapt himself up in his own
observations, and would not speak&mdash;except by his
eyes, which had a comic look, extremely diverting,
of pretended fearful insignificance.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Well, now, my dear Sir, to</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 319]</span></p>
<h4 class="nobreak">MEETING THE THIRD.</h4>

<p>“It was produced by a visit from Mrs. Strange,
with a petition from his Majesty of Abyssinia
for another musical evening; as he had spoken
with so much rapture of the last to Mr. Nesbit, a
great <em>amateur</em>, ‘that the poor honest lad,’ Mrs.
Strange said, ‘could no’ sleep o’ nights from impatience
to be inoculated with the same harmony, to
prevent the infection Mr. Bruce carried about with
him from doing him a mischief.’</p>

<p>“Well, the time was fixed, and the evening proved
so agreeable, that we heartily and continually wished
our dear Mr. Crisp amongst us. Mr. Twining, too,
was gone. All one likes best go quickest.</p>

<p>“The first who arrived was Mr. Solly. He, also,
is a great traveller, though not a renowned one; for
nothing less than the Nile, and no place short of
Abyssinia, will do, at present, for the taste of the
public. My father had met with Mr. Solly at four
several cities in Italy, and all accidentally; namely,
Bologna, Florence, Rome, and Naples. Since that time,
Mr. Solly has been wandering to many more remote
places; and at Alexandria, and at Grand Cairo, he
had met with Mr. Bruce. He is a chatty, lively man;

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 320]</span>

and not at all wanting in marks of his foreign excursions,
<em>i.e.</em> shrugs, jerks, and gestures. John Bull,
you know, my dear Mr. Crisp, when left to himself,
is so torpid a sort of figure, with his arms slung so
lank to his sides, that, at a little distance, one might
fancy him without any such limb. While the Italians
and French make such a flourishing display of its
powers, that I verily believe it quickens circulation,
and helps to render them so much more vivacious
than philosopher Johnny.</p>

<p>“Yet I love Johnny best, for all that; as well as
honour him the most; only I often wish he was a
little more entertaining.</p>

<p>“Mr. Solly and my father ‘fought all their battles
o’er again’ through Italy; and kept fighting them
on till the arrival of Dr. Russel, a learned, and likewise
a travelled physician, who seems droll and
clever; but who is so very short-sighted, that even
my father and I see further a-field. He loses nothing,
however, through this infirmity, that trouble
can supply; for he peers in every body’s face at
least a minute, to discover whether or not he knows
them; and, after that, he peers a minute or two
more, to discover, I suppose, whether or not he likes
them. Yet, without boldness. ’Tis merely a look of

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 321]</span>

earnest investigation, which he bestowed, in turn,
upon every one present, as they came in his way;
never fastening his eyes, even for an instant, upon
the ground, the fire, the wainscot, or any thing
inanimate, but always upon the ‘human face divine.’</p>

<p>“He, also, is another travelled friend of Mr.
Bruce, whom he knew at Aleppo, where Dr. Russel
resided some years.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>“Then came Mrs. and Miss Strange, and his
Abyssinian majesty, with his companion, Mr. Nesbit,
who is a young Scotchman of distinction, infinitely
<i>fade</i>, conceited, and coxcombical. He spoke
very little, except to Mr. Bruce, and that, very
politely, in a whisper. I cannot at all imagine what
could provoke this African monarch to introduce
such a fop here. We heartily wished him back in
his own quarters; or at least at ‘the Orkneys,’
or at ‘the Lord knows where.’</p>

<p>“Mr. Bruce himself was in the most perfect good-humour; all
civility and pleasantry; and his smiles seemed to give liberty for
general ease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 322]</span></p>

<p>“Having paid his compliments to my mother, he
addressed himself to my sister Burney, inquiring
courteously after her finger, which Miss Strange had
told him she had hurt.</p>

<p>“‘Mrs. Burney’s fingers,’ cried Dr. Russel,
snatching at the opportunity for a good gaze, not
upon her finger, but her phiz, ‘ought to be exempt
from all evil.’</p>

<p>“Your Hettina smiled, and assured them it was
almost well.</p>

<p>“‘O, I prayed to Apollo,’ cried Mr. Bruce, ‘for
its recovery, and he has heard my prayer.’</p>

<p>“‘I have no doubt, sir,’ said Hetty, ‘of your
influence with Apollo.’</p>

<p>“‘I ought to have some, Madam,’ answered he
grandly, ‘for I have been a slave to him all my
life!’”</p>

<p>“He then came to hope that I should open the concert;
speaking to me with just such an encouraging
sort of smile as if I had been about eleven years old;
and strongly admonishing me not to delay coming
forward at once, as he was prepared for no common
pleasure in listening to me.</p>

<p>“Next he advanced to Susanna, begging her to
exhibit her talent; and telling her he had had a

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 323]</span>

dream, that if she refused to play, some great misfortune
would befall him.</p>

<p>“When he had gone through this little circle of
gallantry, to his own apparent satisfaction, he suffered
Mr. Nesbit to seize upon him for another
whispering dialogue; in which, as Mrs. Strange has
since told my mother, that pretty swain lamented
that he must soon run away, a certain lady of quality
having taken such an unaccountable fancy to him at
the opera of the preceding night, that she had appointed
him to be with her this evening <i lang="fr">t&ecirc;te &agrave; t&ecirc;te</i>!</p>

<p>“Mr. Bruce gave so little credit to this <i lang="fr">bonne
fortune</i>, that he laughed aloud in relating it to
Mrs. Strange.</p>

<p>“Mr. Bruce then called upon Dr. Russel to take
a violin, saying he was a very fine performer; but
adding, ‘We used to disgrace his talents, I own, at
Aleppo; for, having no blind fiddler at hand, we
kept him playing country dances by the hour.’</p>

<p>“Dr. Russel mentioned some town <em>in those
parts</em>, Asia or Africa, where a concert, upon occasion
of a marriage, lasted three days.</p>

<p>“‘Three days?’ repeated Mr. Bruce; ‘why
marriage is a more formidable thing there than
even here!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 324]</span></p>

<p>“Then came music, and the incomparable duet;
which, as they could not forbear encoring, filled
up all the rest of the evening, till the company at
large departed; for there were several persons present
whom I have not mentioned, being of no zest
for your notice.</p>

<p>“Mr. Bruce, however, with the Stranges, again
consented to stay supper; which, you know, with us,
is nothing but a permission to sit over a table for
chat, and roast potatoes, or apples.</p>

<p>“But now, to perfect your acquaintance with
this towering Ethiopian, where do you think he
will take you during supper?</p>

<p>“To the source, or sources, you cry, of the Nile?
to Thebes? to its temple? to an arietta on the
Theban Harp? or, perhaps, to banquetting on hot
raw beef in Abyssinia?</p>

<p>“No such thing, my dear Mr. Crisp, no such
thing. Travellers who mean to write their travels,
are fit for nothing but to represent the gap at your
whist table at Chesington, when you have only three
players; for they are mere dummies.</p>

<p>“Mr. Bruce left all his exploits, his wanderings,
his vanishings, his re-appearances, his harps so celestial,
and his bullocks so terrestrial, to plant all our

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 325]</span>

entertainment within a hundred yards of our own
coterie; namely, at the masquerades at the Haymarket.</p>

<p>“Thus it was. He inquired of Mrs. Strange where
he could find Mrs. Twoldham, a lady of his acquaintance;
a very fine woman, but remarkably dissipated,
whom he wished to see.</p>

<p>“‘Troth,’ Mrs. Strange answered, ‘she did not
know; but if he would take a turn to a masquerade
or two, he would be sure to light upon her, as she
never missed one.’</p>

<p>“‘What,’ cried he, laughing, ‘has she not had
enough yet of masquerades? Brava, Mrs. Twoldham!
I honour your spirit.’</p>

<p>“He then laughed so cordially, that we were
tempted, by such extraordinary good-humour, to beg
him, almost in a body, to permit us to partake of his
mirth.</p>

<p>“He complied very gaily. ‘A friend of mine,’
he cried, ‘before I went abroad, had so often been
teazed to esquire her to some of these medleys, that
he thought to give the poor woman a surfeit of them
to free himself from her future importunity. Yet
she was a very handsome woman, very handsome
indeed. But just as they were going into the great

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 326]</span>

room, he had got one of her visiting cards ready,
and contrived, as they passed through a crowded
passage, to pin to the back of her robe, Mrs. Twoldham,
Wimpole Street. And not three steps had
she tript forward, before some one called out:
“Hah! Mrs. Twoldham! how do you do, Mrs.
Twoldham?”&mdash;“Oho, Mrs. Twoldham, are you
here?” cried another; “Well, Ma’am, and how do
all friends in Wimpole Street do?” till the poor
woman was half out of her wits, to know how so many
people had discovered her. So she thought that
perhaps her forehead was in sight, and she perked
up her mask; but she did not less hear, “Ah! it’s
you, Mrs. Twoldham, is it?” Then she supposed
she had left a peep at her chin, and down again was
tugged the poor mask; but still, “Mrs. Twoldham!”
and, “how do you do, my dear Mrs. Twoldham?”
was rung in her ears at every step; till at last, she
took it into her head that some one, who, by chance,
had detected her, had sent her name round the
room; so she hurried off like lightning to the upper
suite of apartments. But ’twas all the same. “Well,
I declare, if here is not Mrs. Twoldham!” cries the
first person that passed her. “So she is, I protest,”
cried another; “I am very glad to see you, my dear

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 327]</span>

Ma’am! what say you to giving me a little breakfast
to-morrow morning? you know where, Mrs. Twoldham;
at our old haunt in Wimpole Street.” But,
at last, the corner of an unlucky table rubbed off
the visiting card; and a waiter, who picked it up,
grinned from ear to ear, and asked whether it was
hers. And the poor woman fell into such a trance
of passion, that my friend was afraid for his eyes;
and all the more, because, do what he would, he
could not refrain from laughing in her face.’</p>

<p>“You can scarcely conceive how heartily he
laughed himself; he quite chuckled, with all the
enjoyment in mischief of a holiday school boy.</p>

<p>“And he harped upon the subject with such
facetious pleasure, that no other could be started.</p>

<p>“‘I once knew,’ he cried, ‘a man, his name was
Robert Chambers, and a good-natured little fellow
he was, who was served this very trick the first masquerade
he went to in London, upon fresh coming
from Scotland. A gentleman who went to it with
him, wrote upon his black domino, with chalk, “this
is little Bob Chambers, fresh come from Edinburgh;”
and immediately some one called out, in passing
him, “What Bob? little Bob Chambers? how do, my boy?”
“Faith,” says Bob, to his friend,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 328]</span>

“the people of this fine London are pretty impudent!
I don’t know that I know a soul in the
whole town, and the first person I meet makes free
to call me plain Bob?” But when he went on, and
found that every creature in every room did the
same, he grew quite outrageous at being treated
with so little ceremony; and he stamped with his
foot at one, and clenched his fist at another, and
asked how they dared call him Bob? “What!
a’n’t you Bob, then?” replies one; “O yes, you
are! you’re Bob, my Bob, as sure as a gun! Bob
Chambers! little Bob Chambers. And I hope you
have left all well at Edinburgh, my Bob?” In vain
he rubbed by them, and tried to get on, for they
called to him quite from a distance; “Bob!&mdash;Bob!
come hither, I say!&mdash;come hither, my Bobby! my
Bob of all Bobs! you’re welcome from Edinburgh,
my Bob!” Well, then, he said, ’twas clear the
devil owed him a spite, and had told his name from
top to bottom of every room. Poor Bob! he made
a wry face at the very sound of a masquerade to the
end of his days.’</p>

<p>“To have looked at Mr. Bruce in his glee at this
buffoonery, you must really have been amused;
though methinks I see, supposing you had been

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 329]</span>

with us, the picturesque rising of your brow, and all
the dignity of your Roman nose, while you would
have stared at such familiar delight in an active
joke, as to transport into so merry an <i lang="fr">espiegle</i>,
the seven-footed loftiness of the haughty and imperious
tourist from the sands of Ethiopia, and the
waters of Abyssinia; whom, nevertheless, I have
now the honour to portray in his <i lang="fr">robe de chambre</i>,
i.e. in private society, to my dear Chesington
Daddy.</p>

<p>“What says he to the portrait?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 330]</span></p>

<p>With fresh pleasure and alacrity, Dr. Burney now
went on with his work. So unlooked for a re-inforcement
of his means could not have arrived more
seasonably. Every discovery, or development, relative
to early times, was not only of essential service
to the Dissertation on the Music of the Ancients,
upon which, now, he was elaborately engaged, but
excited general curiosity in all lovers of antiquity.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS.</h3>

<p>Amongst other new friends that this new neighbourhood
procured, or confirmed, to Dr. Burney,
there was one of so congenial, so Samaritan, a sort,
that neighbour he must have been to the Doctor
from the time of their first acquaintance, had his
residence been in Dorset-square, or at Botolph’s
Wharf; instead of Leicester-square, and scarcely
twenty yards from the Doctor’s own short street.</p>

<p>Sir Joshua Reynolds, this good Samaritan, was, like
Dr. Burney, though well-read and deeply studious,
as easy and natural in discourse as if he had been
merely a man of the world; and though his own

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 331]</span>

art was his passion, he was open to the warmest
admiration of every other: and again, like the Doctor,
he was gay though contemplative, and flew
from indolence, though he courted enjoyment.
There was a striking resemblance in the general
amenity of their intercourse, that not only made
them, at all times, and with all persons, free from
any approach to envy, peevishness, or sarcasm
themselves, but seemed to spread around them a
suavity that dissolved those angry passions in others.</p>

<p>In his chronological doggrels, Dr. Burney records
that he now began his intimacy with the great
English Raphael; of whom he adds,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="smaller">
    <div class="verse-first-line">“’Twere vain throughout Europe to look for his peer</div>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">MRS. REYNOLDS.</h3>

<p>Sir Joshua had a maiden sister, Mrs. Frances
Reynolds; a woman of worth and understanding,
but of a singular character; who, unfortunately for
herself, made, throughout life, the great mistake of
nourishing that singularity which was her bane,
as if it had been her blessing.</p>

<p>She lived with Sir Joshua at this time, and stood

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 332]</span>

high in the regard of his firm and most honoured
friend, Dr. Johnson; who saw and pitied her foible,
but tried to cure it in vain. It was that of living
in an habitual perplexity of mind, and irresolution of
conduct, which to herself was restlessly tormenting,
and to all around her was teazingly wearisome.</p>

<p>Whatever she suggested, or planned, one day,
was reversed the next; though resorted to on the
third, as if merely to be again rejected on the
fourth; and so on, almost endlessly; for she rang
not the changes in her opinions and designs in order
to bring them into harmony and practice; but
waveringly to stir up new combinations and difficulties;
till she found herself in the midst of such
chaotic obstructions as could chime in with no given
purpose; but must needs be left to ring their own
peal, and to begin again just where they began at
first.</p>

<p>This lady was a no unfrequent visitor in St. Martin’s-street; where,
for her many excellent qualities, she was much esteemed.</p>

<p>The Miss Palmers,<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
also, two nieces of Sir Joshua,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 333]</span>

lived with him then occasionally; and one of them,
afterwards, habitually; and added to the grace of
his table, and of his evening circles, by the pleasingness
of their manners, and the beauty of their
persons.</p>

<p>Mrs. Frances Reynolds desired to paint Dr. Burney’s
portrait, that she might place it among certain
other worthies of her choice, already ornamenting
her dressing-room. The Doctor had little time
to spare; but had too natively the spirit of the
old school, to suffer No! and a lady, to pair off
together.</p>

<p>During his sittings, one trait of her tenacious
humour occurred, that he was always amused in
relating. While she was painting his hair, which
was remarkably thick, she asked him, very gravely,
whether he could let her have his wig some day to
work at, without troubling him to sit.</p>

<p>“My wig?” repeated he, much surprised.</p>

<p>“Yes;” she answered; “have not you more
than one? can’t you spare it?”</p>

<p>“Spare it?&mdash;Why what makes you think it a
wig? It’s my own hair.”</p>

<p>“O then, I suppose,” said she, with a smile, “I
must not call it a wig?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 334]</span></p>

<p>“Not call it a wig?&mdash;why what for, my clear
Madam, should you call it a wig?”</p>

<p>“Nay, Sir,” replied she, composedly, “if you do
not like it, I am sure I won’t.”</p>

<p>And he protested, that though he offered her
every proof of twisting, twitching, and twirling that
she pleased, she calmly continued painting, without
heeding his appeal for the hairy honours of his
head; and only coolly repeating, “I suppose, then,
I must not call it a wig?”</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">MRS. BROOKES.</h3>

<p>Mrs. Brookes, authoress of “Lady Julia Mandeville,”
&amp;c., having become a joint proprietor of the
Opera House with Mr. and Mrs. Yates, earnestly
coveted the acquaintance of Dr. Burney; in which,
of course, was included the benefit of his musical
opinions, his skill, and his counsel.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brookes had much to combat in order to
receive the justice due to her from the world; for
nature had not been more kind in her mental, than
hard in her corporeal gifts. She was short, broad,
crooked, ill-featured, and ill-favoured; and she had
a cast of the eye that made it seem looking every

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 335]</span>

way rather than that which she meant for its direction.
Nevertheless, she always ultimately obtained
the consideration that she merited. She was free
from pretension, and extremely good-natured. All of
assumption, by which she might have claimed literary
rank, from the higher and graver part of her
works, was wholly set aside in conversation; where,
however different in grace and appearance, she was
as flowing, as cheerful, and as natural in dialogue,
as her own popular and pleasing “Rosina.”<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">MISS REID.</h3>

<p>Miss Reid, the Rosalba of Britain, who, in crayons,
had a grace and a softness of colouring rarely
surpassed, was a visitor likewise at the house, whose
works and whose person were almost divertingly,
as was remarked by Mr. Twining, at variance with
one another; for while the works were all loveliness,
their author was saturnine, cold, taciturn;
absent to an extreme; awkward and full of mischances
in every motion; ill-accoutred, even beyond
negligence, in her dress; and plain enough to

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 336]</span>

produce, grotesquely, an effect that was almost
picturesque.</p>

<p>Yet, with all this outward lack of allurement,
her heart was kind, her temper was humane, and
her friendships were zealous. But she had met
with some misfortunes in early life that had embittered
her existence, and kept it always wavering,
in a miserable balance, between heartless apathy,
and pining discontent.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">MRS. ORD.</h3>

<p>An acquaintance was now, also, begun, with one
of the most valued, valuable, and lasting friends of
Dr. Burney and his family, Mrs. Ord; a lady of
great mental merit, strict principles, and dignified
manners.</p>

<p>Without belonging to what was called the Blues,
or <cite>Bas Bleu</cite> Society, except as a receiver or a visitor,
she selected parties from that set to mix with those
of other, or of no denomination, that were sometimes
peculiarly well assorted, and were always
generally agreeable.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ord’s was the first coterie into which the
Doctor, after his abode in St. Martin’s-Street, initiated

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 337]</span>

his family; Mrs. Burney as a participator, his
daughters as appendages, of what might justly be
called a <i lang="fr">conversatione</i>.</p>

<p>The good sense, serene demeanour, and cheerful
politeness of the lady of the house, made the first
meeting so pleasingly animating to every one present,
that another and another followed, from time
to time, for a long series of years. What Dr. Burney
observed upon taking leave of this first little assemblage,
may be quoted as applicable to every other.</p>

<p>“I rejoice, Madam,” he said, “to find that there
are still two or three houses, even in these dissipated
times, where, through judgment and taste in their
selection, people may be called together, not with
the aid of cards, to kill time, but with that of conversation,
to give it life.”</p>

<p>“And I rejoice the more in the success of Mrs.
Ord,” cried Mr. Pepys,<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
“because I have known many meetings utterly fail, where equal pleasure
has been proposed and expected; but where, though
the ingredients, also, have been equally good&mdash;the
pudding has proved very bad in the eating!”</p>

<p>“The best ingredients,” said Dr. Burney, “however

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 338]</span>

excellent they may be separately, always prove
inefficient if they are not well blended; for if any
one of them is a little too sour, or a little too bitter&mdash;nay,
or a little too sweet, they counteract each other.
But Mrs. Ord is an excellent cook, and employs all
the refinements of her art in taking care not to put
clashing materials into the same mess.”</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">HON. MR. BRUDENEL.</h3>

<p>His Honour, Brudenel,<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
loved and sought Dr. Burney with the most faithful admiration from
a very early period; and, to the latest in his power, he manifested
the same partiality. Though by no means a man of talents, he made his
way to the grateful and lasting regard of Dr. Burney, by constancy of
personal attachment, and a fervour of devotion to the art through which
the distinction of the Doctor had had its origin.</p>

<p>Dr. Ogle, Dean of Winchester,<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
a man of facetious pleasantry, yet of real sagacity;
though mingled with eccentricities, perversities, and
decidedly republican

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 339]</span>

principles, became a warm admirer of the character
and conversation of the Doctor; while the
exemplary Mrs. Ogle and her sprightly daughters
united to enliven his reception, in Berkeley-square,
as an honoured instructor, and a cordial friend.</p>

<p>But with far more political congeniality the President
of the Royal Society, Sir Joseph Banks, was
included in this new amical committee.</p>

<p>In a loose manuscript of recurrence to the year
1776, stand these words upon the first Dr. Warren.</p>

<div class="topspace2"></div>

<blockquote>
<p>“In January of this year, an acquaintance which I had already
begun with that most agreeable of men, Dr. Warren, grew into
intimacy. His conversation was the most pleasant, and, nearly,
the most enlightened, without pedantry or dogmatism, that I had
ever known.”</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="topspace2"></div>

<p>Amongst the distinguished persons appertaining
to this numerous list of connexions upon the opening
of the St. Martin’s-street residence during the last
century, one, at least, still remains to ornament,
both by his writings and his conversation, the present,
Dr. Gillies; whose urbanity of mind and manners,
joined to his literary merits, made him, at his own
pleasure, one of the most estimable and honourable
contributors to the Doctor’s social circle.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 340]</span></p>
<h3 class="nobreak">MR. CUTLER.</h3>

<p>But the most prominent in eagerness to claim the
Doctor’s regard, and to fasten upon his time, with
wit, humour, learning, and eccentric genius, that
often made him pleasant, and always saved him from
becoming insignificant; though with an officious
zeal, and an obtrusive kindness that frequently
caused him to be irksome, must be ranked Mr.
Cutler, a gentleman of no common parts, and certainly
of no common conduct; who loved Dr. Burney
with an ardour the most sincere, but which he
had not attraction to make reciprocal; who wrote
him letters of a length interminable, yet with a frequency
of repetition that would have rendered even
little billets wearisome; and who, satisfied of the
truth of his feelings, investigated not their worth,
and never doubted their welcome.</p>

<p>The Doctor had a heart too grateful and too
gentle to roughly awaken such friendship from its
error; he endured, therefore, its annoyance, till the
intrusion upon his limited leisure became a serious
persecution. He then, almost perforce, sought to
render him more considerate by neglect, in wholly
omitting to answer his letters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 341]</span></p>

<p>But Mr. Cutler, though hurt and chagrined, was
not quieted. Letter still followed letter, detailing
at full length his own ideas upon every subject he
could start; with kind assurances of his determined
patient expectance of future replies.</p>

<p>The Doctor then was reduced to frankly offer a
remonstrance upon the difference of their position
with respect to time,&mdash;and its claims.</p>

<p>This, though done with softness and delicacy,
opened all at once the eyes of this pertinacious
friend to his unreflecting insufficiency; but, of
course, rather with a feeling of injury, than to a
sense of justice; and he withdrew abruptly from all
correspondence; powerfully piqued, yet in silent,
uncomplaining dismay.</p>

<p>To give an idea of his singular style, some few
extracts, of the most uncommon sort, will be selected
for the correspondence, from the vast volume of
letters that will be consigned to the flames.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">MR. BARRY.</h3>

<p>The most striking, however, though by no means
the most reasonable converser amongst those who

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 342]</span>

generally volunteered their colloquial services in
St. Martin’s-street, was that eminent painter, and
entertaining character, Mr. Barry; who, with a
really innocent belief that he was the most modest
and moderate of men, nourished the most insatiable
avidity of applause; who, with a loudly laughing
defiance of the ills of life, was internally and substantially
sinking under their annoyance; and who,
with a professed and sardonic contempt of rival
prosperity or superiority, disguised, even to himself,
the bitterness with which he pined at the success
which he could not share, but to which he flattered
himself that he was indifferent, or above; because
so to be, behoved the character of his believed adoption,
that of a genuine votary to philanthropy and
philosophy.</p>

<p>His ideas and his views of his art he held, and
justly, to be sublime; but his glaring execution of
the most chaste designs left his practice in the lurch,
even where his theory was most perfect.</p>

<p>He disdained to catch any hints from the works,
much less from the counsel, of Sir Joshua Reynolds;
from whose personal kindness and commanding
abilities he had unfortunately been cut off by early
disagreement; for nearly as they approached each

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 343]</span>

other in their ideas, and their knowledge of their
art, their process, in cultivating their several talents,
had as little accord, as their method of organizing
their intellectual attributes and characters. And,
indeed, the inveterate dissension of Barry with Sir
Joshua Reynolds, must always be in his own disfavour,
though his harder fate must mingle pity
with censure&mdash;little thankfully as his high spirit
would have accepted such a species of mitigation.
It is not, however, probable, that the fiery Mr.
Barry should have received from the serene and
candid Sir Joshua, the opening provocation; Sir
Joshua, besides his unrivalled professional merits,<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
had a negative title to general approbation, that
included many an affirmative one; “Sir Joshua
Reynolds,” said Dr. Johnson,<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
“possesses the largest share of inoffensiveness of any
man that I know.”</p>

<p>Yet Mr. Barry had many admirable as well as
uncommon qualities. His moral sentiments were
liberal, nay, noble; he was full fraught, almost
bursting with vigorous genius; and his eccentricities,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 344]</span>

both in manner and notions, made his company
generally enlightening, and always original
and entertaining.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<h3 class="nobreak">GARRICK.</h3>

<p>The regret that stood next, or, rather, that stood
alone with Dr. Burney, to that of losing the pure
air and bright view of Hampstead and Highgate, by
this change to St. Martin’s-street, was missing the
frequency of the visits of Mr. Garrick; to whom the
Queen-Square of that day was so nearly out of town,
that to arrive at it on foot had almost the refreshment
of a country walk.</p>

<p>St. Martin’s-street, on the contrary, was situated
in the populous closeness of the midst of things;
and not a step could Garrick take in its vicinity,
without being recognised and stared at, if not pursued
and hailed, by all the common herd of his
gallery admirers; those gods to whom so often he
made his fond appeal; and who formed, in fact, a
principal portion of his fame, and, consequently, of
his happiness, by the honest tribute of their vociferous
plaudits.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, these jovial gods, though vivifying

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 345]</span>

to him from their high abode, and in a mass, at the
theatre, must, in partial groups, from the exertions
he could never refrain from making to keep alive
with almost whatever was living, his gay popularity,
be seriously fatiguing, by crowding about him in
narrow streets, dirty crossings, and awkward nooks
and corners, such as then abounded in that part of
the town; though still his buoyant spirits, glowing
and unequalled, retained their elastic pleasure in
universal admiration.</p>

<p>An instance of this preponderating propensity
greatly diverted Dr. Burney, upon the first visit of
Mr. Garrick to St. Martin’s-street.</p>

<p>This visit was very matinal; and a new housemaid,
who was washing the steps of the door, and
did not know him, offered some resistance to letting
him enter the house unannounced: but, grotesquely
breaking through her attempted obstructions, he
forcibly ascended the stairs, and rushed into the
Doctor’s study; where his voice, in some mock heroics
to the damsel, alone preceded him.</p>

<p>Here he found the Doctor immersed in papers,
manuscripts, and books, though under the hands of
his hair-dresser; while one of his daughters was
reading a newspaper to him;<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
another was making

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 346]</span>

his tea,<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
and another was arranging his books.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>The Doctor, beginning a laughing apology for the
literary and littered state of his apartment, endeavoured
to put things a little to rights, that he might
present his ever welcome guest with a vacated chair.
But Mr. Garrick, throwing himself plumply into
one that was well-cushioned with pamphlets and
memorials, called out: “Ay, do now, Doctor, be
in a little confusion! whisk your matters all out of
their places; and don’t know where to find a thing
that you want for the rest of the day;&mdash;and that will
make us all comfortable!”</p>

<p>The Doctor now, laughingly leaving his disorder
to take care of itself, resumed his place on the stool;
that the furniture of his head might go through its
proper repairs.</p>

<p>Mr. Garrick then, assuming a solemn gravity,
with a profound air of attention, fastened his eyes
upon the hair-dresser; as if wonder-struck at his
amazing skill in decorating the Doctor’s <i lang="fr">t&ecirc;te</i>.</p>

<p>The man, highly gratified by such notice from

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 347]</span>

the celebrated Garrick, briskly worked on, frizzing,
curling, powdering, and pasting, according to the
mode of the day, with assiduous, though flurried
importance, and with marked self-complacency.</p>

<p>Mr. Garrick himself had on what he called his
scratch wig; which was so uncommonly ill-arranged
and frightful, that the whole family agreed no one
else could have appeared in such a plight in the
public streets, without a risk of being hooted at by
the mob.</p>

<p>He dropt now all parley whatsoever with the
Doctor, not even answering what he said; and
seemed wholly absorbed in admiring watchfulness of
the progress of the hair-dresser; putting on, by
degrees, with a power like transformation, a little
mean face of envy and sadness, such as he wore in
representing Abel Drugger; which so indescribably
altered his countenance, as to make his young admirers
almost mingle incredulity of his individuality
with their surprise and amusement; for, with his
mouth hanging stupidly open, he fixed his features
in so vacant an absence of all expression, that he
less resembled himself than some daubed wooden
block in a barber’s shop window.</p>

<p>The Doctor, perceiving the metamorphosis, smiled

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 348]</span>

in silent observance. But the friseur, who at first
had smirkingly felt flattered at seeing his operations
thus curiously remarked, became utterly discountenanced
by so incomprehensible a change, and so
unremitting a stare; and hardly knew what he was
about. The more, however, he pomatumed and
powdered, and twisted the Doctor’s curls, the more
palpable were the signs that Mr. Garrick manifested
of</p>

<div class="topspace1"></div>

<p class="center smaller">“Wonder with a foolish face of praise;”</p>

<div class="topspace1"></div>

<p>till, little by little, a species of consternation began
to mingle with the embarrassment of the hair-manufacturer.
Mr. Garrick then, suddenly starting up,
gawkily perked his altered physiognomy, with the
look of a gaping idiot, full in the man’s face.</p>

<p>Scared and confounded, the perruquier now turned
away his eyes, and hastily rolled up two curls, with
all the speed in his power, to make his retreat. But
before he was suffered to escape, Mr. Garrick, lifting
his own miserable scratch from his head, and
perching it high up in the air upon his finger and
thumb, dolorously, in a whining voice, squeaked out,
“Pray now, Sir, do you think, Sir, you could touch
me up this here old bob a little bit, Sir?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 349]</span></p>

<p>The man now, with open eyes, and a broad grin,
scampered pell-mell out of the room; hardly able to
shut the door, ere an uncontrollable horse-laugh
proclaimed his relieved perception of Mr. Garrick’s
mystification.</p>

<p>Mr. Garrick then, looking smilingly around him
at the group, which, enlarged by his first favourite
young Charles, most smilingly met his arch glances,
sportively said, “And so, Doctor, you, with your
tag rag and bobtail there&mdash;”</p>

<p>Here he pointed to some loaded shelves of shabby
unbound old books and pamphlets, which he started
up to recognise, in suddenly assuming the air of a
smart, conceited, underling auctioneer; and rapping
with his cane upon all that were most worn and defaced,
he sputtered out: “A penny a-piece! a penny
a-piece! a-going! a-going! a-going! a penny
a-piece! each worth a pound!&mdash;not to say a hundred!
a rare bargain, gemmen and ladies! a rare
bargain! down with your copper!”</p>

<p>Then, quietly re-seating himself, “And so, Doctor,”
he continued, “you, and tag-rag and bobtail,
there, shut yourself up in this snug little book-stall,
with all your blithe elves around you, to rest your
understanding?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 350]</span></p>

<p>Outcries now of “Oh fie!” “Oh abominable!”
“Rest his understanding? how shocking!” were
echoed in his ears with mock indignancy from the
mock-offended set, accompanied by hearty laughter
from the Doctor.</p>

<p>Up rose Mr. Garrick, with a look of pretended
perturbation, incoherently exclaiming, “You mistake&mdash;you
quite misconceive&mdash;you do, indeed! pray
be persuaded of it!&mdash;I only meant&mdash;I merely intended&mdash;be
sure of that!&mdash;be very sure of that!&mdash;I
only purposed; that is, I designed&mdash;I give you my
word&mdash;’pon honour, I do!&mdash;I give you my word of
that!&mdash;I only had in view&mdash;in short, and to cut the
matter short, I only aimed at paying you&mdash;pray now
take me right!&mdash;at paying you the very finest compliment
in nature!”</p>

<p>“Bravo, bravo! Mr. Bayes!” cried the Doctor,
clapping his hands: “nothing can be clearer!&mdash;”</p>

<p>Mr. Garrick had lent the Doctor several books of
reference; and he now inquired the titles and number
of what were at present in his possession.</p>

<p>“I have ten volumes,” answered the Doctor,
“of Memoirs of the French Academy.”</p>

<p>“And what others?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know&mdash;do you, Fanny?”&mdash;turning to
his librarian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 351]</span></p>

<p>“What! I suppose, then,” said Mr. Garrick,
with an ironical cast of the eye, “you don’t choose
to know that point yourself?&mdash;Eh?&mdash;O, very well,
Sir, very well!” rising, and scraping round the
room with sundry grotesque bows, obsequiously
low and formal; “quite well, Sir! Pray make
free with me! Pray keep them, if you choose it!
Pray stand upon no ceremony with me, Sir!”</p>

<p>Dr. Burney then hunted for the list; and when
he had found it, and they had looked it over, and
talked it over, Mr. Garrick exclaimed, “But when,
Doctor, when shall we have out the History of
Histories? Do let me know in time, that I may
prepare to blow the trumpet of fame.”</p>

<p>He then put his cane to his mouth, and, in the
voice of a raree showman, squalled out, shrilly and
loudly: “This is your only true History, gemmen!
Please to buy! please to buy! come and buy! ’Gad,
Sir, I’ll blow it in the ear of every scurvy pretender
to rivalship. So, buy! gemmen, buy! The only
true History! No counterfeit, but all alive!”</p>

<p>Dr. Burney invited him to the parlour, to
breakfast; but he said he was engaged at home,
to Messrs. Twiss and Boswell; whom immediately,
most gaily and ludicrously, he took off to
the life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 352]</span></p>

<p>Elated by the mirth with which he enlivened his
audience, he now could not refrain from imitating,
in the same manner, even Dr. Johnson: but not
maliciously, though very laughably. He sincerely
honoured, nay, loved Dr. Johnson; but Dr. Johnson,
he said, had peculiarities of such unequalled
eccentricity, that even to his most attached, nay,
to his most reverential admirers, they were irresistibly
provoking to mimicry.</p>

<p>Mr. Garrick, therefore, after this apology, casting
off his little, mean, snivelling Abel Drugger
appearance, began displaying, and, by some
inconceivable arrangement of his habiliments, most
astonishingly enlarging his person, so as to make
it seem many inches above its native size; not only
in breadth, but, strange yet true to tell, in height,
whilst exhibiting sundry extraordinary and uncouth
attitudes and gestures.</p>

<p>Pompously, then, assuming an authoritative port
and demeanour, and giving a thundering stamp with
his foot on some mark on the carpet that struck his
eye&mdash;not with passion or displeasure, but merely
as if from absence and singularity; he took off the
voice, sonorous, impressive, and oratorical, of Dr.
Johnson, in a short dialogue with himself that had
passed the preceding week.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 353]</span></p>

<p>“David!&mdash;will you lend me your Petrarca?”</p>

<p>“Y-e-s, Sir!&mdash;”</p>

<p>“David! you sigh?”</p>

<p>“Sir&mdash;you shall have it, certainly.”</p>

<p>“Accordingly,” Mr. Garrick continued, “the
book&mdash;stupendously bound&mdash;I sent to him that very
evening. But&mdash;scarcely had he taken the noble
quarto in his hands, when&mdash;as Boswell tells me, he
poured forth a Greek ejaculation, and a couplet or
two from Horace; and then, in one of those fits
of enthusiasm which always seem to require that
he should spread his arms aloft in the air, his haste
was so great to debarrass them for that purpose,
that he suddenly pounces my poor Petrarca over
his head upon the floor! Russia leather, gold border,
and all! And then, standing for several minutes
erect, lost in abstraction, he forgot, probably, that he
had ever seen it; and left my poor dislocated Beauty
to the mercy of the housemaid’s morning mop!”</p>

<p>Phill, the favourite little spaniel, was no more;
but a young greyhound successor followed Mr. Garrick
about the study, incessantly courting his notice,
and licking his hands. “Ah, poor Phill!” cried
he, looking at the greyhound contemptuously, “<em>You</em>
will never take his place, Slabber-chops! though you

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 354]</span>

try for it hard and soft. Soft enough, poor whelp!
like all your race; tenderness without ideas.”</p>

<p>After he had said adieu, and left the room, he
hastily came back, whimsically laughing, and said,
“Here’s one of your maids down stairs that I love
prodigiously to speak to, because she is so cross!
She was washing, and rubbing and scrubbing, and
whitening and brightening your steps this morning,
and would hardly let me pass. Egad, Sir, she did
not know the great Roscius! But I frightened her
a little, just now: ‘Child,’ says I, ‘you don’t guess
whom you have the happiness to see! Do you
know I am one of the first geniuses of the age?
You would faint away upon the spot if you could
only imagine who I am!’”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Another time, an appointment having been arranged
by Dr. Burney for presenting his friend
Mr. Twining to Mr. Garrick, the two former, in
happy conference, were enjoying the society of each
other, while awaiting the promised junction with
Mr. Garrick, when a violent rapping at the street
door, which prepared them for his welcome arrival,
was followed by a demand, through the footman,

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 355]</span>

whether the Doctor could receive Sir Jeremy Hillsborough;
a baronet who was as peculiarly distasteful
to both the gentlemen, as Mr. Garrick was the reverse.</p>

<p>“For heaven’s sake, no!” cried Mr. Twining;
and the Doctor echoing “No! No! No!” was
with eagerness sending off a hasty excuse, when the
footman whispered, “Sir, he’s at my heels! he’s
close to the door! he would not stop!” And,
strenuously flinging open the library door himself
in a slouching hat, an old-fashioned blue rocolo,
over a great-coat of which the collar was turned up
above his ears, and a silk handkerchief, held, as if
from the tooth-ache, to his mouth, the forbidden
guest entered; slowly, lowly, and solemnly bowing
his head as he advanced; though, quaker-like, never
touching his hat, and not uttering a word.</p>

<p>The Doctor, whom Sir Jeremy had never before
visited, and to whom he was hardly known, save by
open dissimilarity upon some literary subjects; and
Mr. Twining, to whom he was only less a stranger
to be yet more obnoxious, from having been at variance
with his family; equally concluded, from their
knowledge of his irascible character, that the visit
had no other view than that of demanding satisfaction
for some offence supposed to have been offered

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 356]</span>

to his high self-importance. And, in the awkwardness
of such a surmise, they could not but feel disconcerted,
nay abashed, at having proclaimed their
averseness to his sight in such unqualified terms,
and immediately within his hearing.</p>

<p>For a minute or two, with a silence like his own,
they awaited an explanation of his purpose; when,
after some hesitation, ostentatiously waving one
hand, while the other still held his handkerchief to
his mouth, the unwelcome intruder, to their utter
astonishment, came forward; and composedly seated
himself in an arm-chair near the fire; filling it
broadly, with an air of domineering authority.</p>

<p>The gentlemen now looked at each other, in
some doubt whether their visitor had not found his
way to them from the vicinity of Moorfields.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>The pause that ensued was embarrassing, and not
quite free from alarm; when the intruder, after an
extraordinary nod or two, of a palpably threatening
nature, suddenly started up, threw off his slouched
hat and old rocolo, flung his red silk handkerchief
into the ashes, and displayed to view, lustrous with
vivacity, the gay features, the sparkling eyes, and

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 357]</span>

laughing countenance of Garrick,&mdash;the inimitable
imitator, David Garrick.</p>

<p>Dr. Burney, delighted at this development, clapped
his hands, as if the scene had been represented at a
theatre: and all his family present joined rapturously
in the plaudit: while Mr. Twining, with the happy
surprise of a sudden exchange from expected disgust
to accorded pleasure, eagerly approached the
arm-chair, for a presentation which he had longed
for nearly throughout his life.</p>

<p>Mr. Garrick then, with many hearty reciprocations
of laughter, expounded the motive to the feat
which he had enacted.</p>

<p>He had awaked, he said, that morning, under
the formidable impression of an introduction to a
profound Greek scholar, that was almost awful; and
that had set him to pondering upon the egregious
loss of time and pleasurability that hung upon all
formalities in making new acquaintances; and he
then set his wits to work at devising means for
skipping at once, by some sleight of hand, into abrupt
cordiality. And none occurred that seemed so promising
of spontaneous success, as presenting himself
under the aspect of a person whom he knew to be so
desperately unpleasant to the scholiast, that, at the

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 358]</span>

very sound of his name, he would inwardly ejaculate,</p>

<div class="topspace1"></div>

<p class="center smaller">“Take any form but that!”</p>

<div class="topspace1"></div>

<p>Here, in a moment, Mr. Garrick was in the
centre of the apartment, in the attitude of Hamlet
at sight of the ghost.</p>

<p>This burlesque frolic over, which gave a playful
vent that seemed almost necessary to the superabundant
animal spirits of Mr. Garrick, who, as Dr. Johnson
has said of Shakespeare, “was always struggling
for an occasion to be comic,” he cast away farce and
mimicry; and became, for the rest of the visit, a judicious,
intelligent, and well informed, though ever
lively and entertaining converser and man of letters:
and Mr. Twining had not been more amused by his
buffoonery, than he grew charmed by his rationality.</p>

<p>In the course of the conversation, the intended
Encyclopedia of Dr. Goldsmith being mentioned,
and the Doctor’s death warmly regretted, a description
of the character as well as works of that charming
author was brought forward; and Mr. Garrick
named, what no one else in his presence could have
hinted at, the poem of Retaliation.</p>

<p>Mr. Garrick had too much knowledge of mankind
to treat with lightness so forcible an attack

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 359]</span>

upon the stability of his friendships, however it
might be softened off by the praise of his talents.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
But he had brought it, he said, upon himself, by an
unlucky lampoon, to which he had irresistibly been
led by the absurd blunders, and the inconceivable
inferiority between the discourse and the pen of
this singular man; who, one evening at the club,
had been so outrageously laughable, that Mr. Garrick
had been betrayed into asserting, that no man
could possibly draw the character of Oliver Goldsmith,
till poor Oliver was under ground; for what
any one would say after an hour’s reading him,
would indubitably be reversed, after an hour’s chat.
“And then,” Mr. Garrick continued, “one risible
folly bringing on another, I voted him to be dead at
that time, that I might give his real character in
his epitaph. And this,” he added, “produced this

<p>Goldsmith, immeasurably piqued, vowed he would
retaliate; but, never ready with his tongue in public,
though always ready with his pen in private, he

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 360]</span>

hurried off in a pet; and, some time after, produced
that best, if not only, satirical poem, that he ever
wrote, “Retaliation.”</p>

<p>This was Dr. Goldsmith’s final work, and did
not come out till after his death. And it was still
unfinished; the last line, which was upon Sir Joshua
Reynolds, being left half written;</p>

<p>To a very general regret, Dr. Johnson had not
yet been named. Probably, he was meant to form
the climax of the piece.</p>

<p>His character, drawn by a man of such acute discrimination,
who had prospered from his friendship,
yet smarted from his wit; who feared, dreaded, and
envied; yet honoured, admired, and loved him;
would doubtless have been sketched with as fine a
pencil of splendid praise, and pointed satire, as has
marked the characteristic distiches upon Mr. Burke
and Mr. Garrick.</p>

The letters of Dr. Johnson were made over to Mr. Boswell
by Dr. Burney, and have already been published; but the modesty
which withheld his own, will not, it is hoped, be thought here to
be violated by printing them in his memoirs; as they not only
shew his early and generous enthusiasm for genius, but carry
with them a striking proof of the genuine urbanity with which
Dr. Johnson was open to every act of kindness that was offered
to him unaffectedly, even from persons the most obscure and
unknown.</p></div>
